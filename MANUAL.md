# Introduction

## About This Document

This document is generated from the Markdown files in `md/*.md`, the rules'
source code (`svlint/src/rules/*.rs`), and their testcases
(`testcases/(fail|pass)/*.sv`) using the `mdgen` utility.


## Purpose of Lint Checks

The authors of any works must consider their audience, particularly in how
different sections of the audience will interpret the works.
For example, an author of childrens books has two main sections of audience
(children, and their adult parents) so they might aim to please both sections
at once; Children with simple storylines and colorful pictures; Parents with
cultural references and subtle innuendo.
Authors writing in SystemVerilog also have two main sections of audience which
they should aim to please: 1) other silicon engineers, 2) mechanical tools.
Although the differences between human and mechanical readers are significant,
both must be satisfied for the text to be nice/enjoyable to work with.
While a simulation tool doesn't care about whitespace, indentation, or
thoughtful comments, your human colleagues will dread working with messy code
(rewiewing, modifying, building upon outputs, etc.), which ultimately wastes
their time, money, and sanity.
Human readers will usually be polite about sub-par work, but tools are much more
direct, simply spitting back at you with warning messages and an outright
refusal to work if you dare to mis-spell a variable name.

There are two main classes of rule for helping human readers:

1. Rules which codify naming conventions.
2. Rules which codify style/formatting conventions.

Further information on these concepts is provided in the `style` ruleset.

Just as individual human readers have their own preferences (in language,
style, naming conventions, etc.), each tool has its own quirks and ways of
interpreting things, particularly when the language specification is not fully
explicit.
The most prominent example of tools' differences in interpretation of
SystemVerilog is between tools for simulation and tools for synthesis.
The SystemVerilog language is specifed in IEEE1800-2017, also known as the
Language Reference Manual (LRM).
The LRM is clear that the specification is written in terms of simulation, but
that some of its constructs may be synthesized into physical hardware.
This distinction is the basis for a class of functional rules which aim to
minimize the risk of introducing a mismatch between simulation and synthesis.
Another class of functional rules is those which check for datatypes and
constructs that avoid compiler checks for legacy compatibility.


## Usage

This tool (svlint) works in a series of well-defined steps:

1. On startup, search for a configuration file or use a default configuration.
2. Examine the configuration to determine which rules should be enabled and
  load them into memory.
3. Parse a whole file for preprocessor constructs like `` `ifdef `` and
  `` `include ``.
4. Apply the preprocessor semantics to produce a source descrition text.
5. Parse the source description into a syntax tree.
  The grammatical structure of a syntax tree is described in IEEE1800-2017
  Annex A using Backus-Naur Form.
6. Iterate over each node of the syntax tree in order.
7. For each node, apply each rule independently.
8. If a rule detects an undesirable quality in the syntax tree, then return a
  failure, otherwise return a pass.


### Filelists

Specification of the files to be processed can be given on the command line by
*either* a list of files (e.g. `svlint foo.sv bar/*.sv`), or via filelists
(e.g. `svlint -f foo.fl -f path/to/bar.fl`).
It is not supported to specify both files and filelists, primarily because
concerns about usability due to the way command-line arguments are processed.

The following features are supported via the
[sv-filelist-parser](https://github.com/supleed2/sv-filelist-parser) crate.

- Lines beginning with `//` or `#` and empty lines are ignored.
- Specify include directories like `+incdir+path/to/foo`.
- Define preprocessor macros like `+define+FOO` or `+define+BAR=1`.
- Include other filelists like `-f path/to/foo.fl`
- All remaining lines are treated as file paths.
- Substitute of environment variables like `$FOO`, `${FOO}`, or `$(FOO)`.

For example:
```
aaa.sv
$FOO/bbb.sv
${FOO}/ccc.sv
$(FOO)/ddd.sv
+incdir+$PWD/header/src
+define+SYNTHESIS
-f anotherFilelist.fl
```


### Plugin rules

Svlint supports plugin rules, an example of which is available
[here](https://github.com/dalance/svlint-plugin-sample).

A plugin rule is one which is compiled separately to the main svlint binary,
and is loaded at runtime.
In the same way as integrated rules, a plugin rule must implement the `Rule`
trait, i.e. `check`, `name`, `hint`, and `reason`.
The `hint` and `reason` methods allow plugin rules to provide information back
to the user on the terminal, but they do not require testcases or an
explanation.
All loaded plugin rules, via the `--plugin` option, are enabled and have access
to all values in the TOML configuration.


### Configuration

First of all, you must put a configuration file `.svlint.toml` to specify enabled rules.
Configuration file is searched to the upper directory until `/`.
So you can put configuration file (`.svlint.toml`) on the repository root
alongside `.gitignore`.
Alternatively, for project-wide rules you can set the environment variable
`SVLINT_CONFIG` to something like `/cad/projectFoo/teamBar.svlint.toml`.

The example of configuration file is below:

```toml
[option]
exclude_paths = ["ip/.*"]
prefix_label = ""

[rules]
non_ansi_module = true
keyword_forbidden_wire_reg = true
```

The complete example can be generated by `svlint --example`


#### `[option]` section

- `exclude_paths` is a list of regular expressions.
  If a file path is matched with any regex in the list, the file is skipped.
- `prefix_(inout|input|output)` are strings which port identifiers must begin
  with.
  Only used when the corresponding rule is enabled.
  Defaults to `"b_"`, `"i_"`, and `"o_"` respectively.
- `prefix_label` is a string which generate labels must begin with.
  Applicable to `if/else`, `for`, and `case` generate constructs when the
  corresponding `generate_*_with_label` rule is enabled.
  Defaults to `"l_"`.
  To check only that a label exists, set this to `""`.
- `prefix_instance` is a string which instances must begin with.
  Defaults to `"u_"`.
- `prefix_(interface|module|package)` are strings which definitions must begin
  with.
  An alternative naming convention for interface, module, and package names is
  uppercase/lowercase first letter.
  This is similar to Haskell where types begin with uppercase and variables
  begin with lowercase.
  These alternative rules are called
  `(lower|upper)camelcase_(interface|module|package)`.
- `re_(forbidden|required)_*` are regular expressions for detailed naming
  conventions, used only when the corresponding rules are enabled.
  The defaults for `re_required_*` are either uppercase, lowercase, or
  mixed-case starting with lowercase, i.e. just vaguely sensible.
  The defaults for `re_forbidden_*` are to forbid all strings, except those
  starting with "X", i.e. not at all sensible (configuration required).

#### `[rules]` section

All rules are disabled unless explicitly enabled in the `[rules]` section.
To enable a rule, assign `true` to its name, e.g. `case_default = true`.

Where no configuration file can be found, all rules are implicitly
enabled which will most likely result in errors from conflicting rules, e.g.
**keyword_forbidden_generate** and **keyword_required_generate**.

If you need to turn off specific rules for a section, then you can use special
comments within your SystemVerilog source code:
```systemverilog
/* svlint off keyword_forbidden_always */
always @* foo = bar;                      // <-- This line is special.
/* svlint on keyword_forbidden_always */
```

#### Configuration update

If svlint is updated, `.svlint.toml` can be updated to the latest version with
`svlint --update`.


## Rule Documentation

Each rule is documented with 5 pieces of information:

- Hint: A brief instruction on how to modify failing SystemVerilog.
  Also displayed in supported editors using [svls](https://github.com/dalance/svls).
- Reason: A one sentence explanation of the rule's purpose.
  Also displayed in supported editors using [svls](https://github.com/dalance/svls).
- Pass Example: A valid piece of SystemVerilog which is known to pass the rule.
  Ideally, this will show an example of best-practice.
- Fail Example: A valid piece of SystemVerilog which is known to fail the rule.
  In some cases the code shows multiple commented examples.
- Explanation: A full explanation of the rule's purpose with references to any
  other relevant information sources.

In each rule's explanation there is a "see also" list of other rules, each with
a short reason why it should be seen.

- "suggested companion" - Suggestions are given for rules which do not check
  semantics, i.e suggestions are for style and naming conventions only.
- "potential companion" - These are noted where the named rule is given
  primarily out of completeness, but their use may cause other issues.
  For example, **style_keyword_datatype** exists to ensure all SystemVerilog
  keywords are captured in the `style_keyword_*` set, but its use is not
  suggested because it is visually appealing (and common practice) to align
  the identifiers in adjacent declarations.
- "useful companion" - Enabling the named rule provides an additional set of
  properties which are useful for reasoning about the function and semantics of
  code which passes.
  For example, the conjunction of **localparam_type_twostate** and
  **localparam_explicit_type** allows for stronger confidence that the author
  has properly considered the type of each constant.
- "alternative" - The named rule *should* not be used in conjunction, i.e.
  enabling both rules is, at best, a waste compute power.
- "mutually exclusive alternative" - The named rule *can* not be used in
  conjunction, i.e. enabling both rules is nonsensical because a failure on one
  implies a pass on the other rule.

You are welcome to suggest a new rule through
[Issues](https://github.com/dalance/svlint/issues) or
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/dalance/svlint/pulls).


# Functional Rules


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Rule: `action_block_with_side_effect`

### Hint

Do not specify side effects within `assert` or `wait_order` action blocks.

### Reason

Side effects may cause undefined event ordering.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always @(posedge clk)
    assert (A)
      else $error("A should be high.");

  // Simulator must report line number, label, and time on each violation.
  asrt_b1: assert property (@(posedge clk) B1)
    else $error("B1 should be high.");
  asrt_b2: assert property (@(posedge clk) B2)
    else $error("B2 should be high.");
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always @(posedge clk)
    assert (A) // These are legal, but potentially confusing.
    else begin
      $display("A should be high."); // Write to STDOUT.

      // Update global variable.
      errorId = 5; // What value if multiple immediate assertions fail?
      errorCount++; // Hopefully simulator blocks between processes.
    end

  // In what order do these action blocks occur?
  asrt_b1: assert property (@(posedge clk) B1)
    else begin
      $display("B1 should be high.");
      errorId = 1;
      errorCount++;
    end;
  asrt_b2: assert property (@(posedge clk) B2)
    else begin
      $display("B2 should be high.");
      errorId = 2;
      errorCount++;
    end;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Simulator event ordering between concurrent action blocks is undefined, so
observed behavior is simulator-dependent.
While assertions with side-effects may appear to work on a single-threaded
simulator, they may interact in unexpected ways on a multi-threaded simulator.
On encountering side-effect code in action blocks, a simulator can either
implement inter-thread locking (with a hit to performance) or allow a
race-condition to occur, neither of which are desirable.

Specifically, action blocks should not contain blocking assignments:
- Blocking assignment operator, e.g. `foo = 123;`
- Increment/decrement operators, e.g. `foo++;`, `foo--;`.
- Sequential IO, e.g. `$display();`, `$write();`.
  The full list of IO system tasks and system functions is given on page 624 of
  IEEE1800-2017.

See also:
- **non_blocking_assignment_in_always_comb** - Useful companion rule.
- **blocking_assignment_in_always_ff** - Useful companion rule.

The most relevant clauses of IEEE1800-2017 are:
- 15.5.4 Event sequencing: wait\_order()
- 16 Assertions
- 21 Input/output system tasks and system functions



* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Rule: `blocking_assignment_in_always_ff`

### Hint

Do not use blocking assignments within `always_ff`.

### Reason

Blocking assignment in `always_ff` may cause undefined event ordering.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge clk) q1 <= d; // Correct.

  /* svlint off blocking_assignment_in_always_ff */
  always_ff @(posedge clk) q2 = d;  // Control comments avoid failure.
  /* svlint on blocking_assignment_in_always_ff */
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
/* svlint off blocking_assignment_in_always_ff */
always_ff @(posedge clk) q1 = d;   // Control comments avoid failure.
/* svlint on blocking_assignment_in_always_ff */

always_ff @(posedge clk) q2 = d;   // Failure.
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Simulator event ordering between blocking and non-blocking assignments
is undefined, so observed behavior is simulator-dependent.
As all examples in IEEE1800-2017 show, `always_ff` should only contain
non-blocking assignments in order for sampling and variable evaluation
to operate in a defined order.

Specifically, `always_ff` constructs should not contain blocking assignments:
- Blocking assignment operator, e.g. `foo = 123;`
- Increment/decrement operators, e.g. `foo++;`, `foo--;`.

See also:
- **blocking_assignment_in_always_latch** - Useful companion rule.
- **non_blocking_assignment_in_always_comb** - Useful companion rule.

The most relevant clauses of IEEE1800-2017 are:
- 4.9.3 Blocking assignment
- 4.9.4 Non-blocking assignment
- 9.2.2.4 Sequential logic `always_ff` procedure
- 9.4.2 Event control
- 10.4.1 Blocking procedural assignments
- 10.4.2 Nonblocking procedural assignments
- 16.5.1 Sampling



* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Rule: `blocking_assignment_in_always_latch`

### Hint

Do not use blocking assignments within `always_latch`.

### Reason

Inconsistent assignments in `always_latch` may cause unexpected event ordering.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_latch
    if (load)
      q <= d;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_latch
    if (load)
      q = d;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Mixed blocking and non-blocking assignments under `always_latch` processes can
be difficult to read, and in the worst cases may lead to mismatches between
simulation and synthesis.

```systemverilog
always_latch
  if (load)
    q_blocking = getD();

always_latch
  if (load)
    q_nonblocking <= getD();
```

Those processes should be equivalent under synthesis, but not necessarily under
simulation where `getD()` has side effects.
For consistent results and readability, this rule prefers non-blocking
assignments in `always_latch` processes.

See also:
- **blocking_assignment_in_always_ff** - Useful companion rule.
- **non_blocking_assignment_in_always_comb** - Useful companion rule.

The most relevant clauses of IEEE1800-2017 are:
- 4.9.3 Blocking assignment
- 4.9.4 Non-blocking assignment
- 9.2.2.3 Latched logic `always_latch` procedure
- 9.4.2 Event control
- 10.4.1 Blocking procedural assignments
- 10.4.2 Nonblocking procedural assignments
- 16.5.1 Sampling

## Rule: `case_default`

### Hint

Use a `default` expression in `case` statements.

### Reason

Incomplete case may cause simulation/synthesis mismatch in `always_comb` and `function`.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    case (x)
      1: y = 0;
      default: y = 0;
    endcase

  always_ff
    case (x)
      1: y = 0;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    case (x)
      1: a = 0;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Explanation

IEEE1800-2017 (clause 9.2.2.2) comments that tools should *warn* if an
`always_comb` procedure infers memory.
However, simulators and synthesis tools are not required to enforce that
`always_comb` procedures only infer combinational logic.
This allows for simulators and synthesis tools to interpret these procedures
differently, which results in a mismatch between simulation and synthesis.

An incomplete case statement may be interpreted as latched logic,
e.g: `always_comb case (foo) '0: a = 5; endcase`.
Only the case where `foo == 0` is specified, to update variable `a` to the
value `5`.
When `foo` is non-zero, this example may be interpreted in at least two ways:
- `a = 'x;` - As the new value is not specified, it is unknown.
  A synthesis tool may allow node `a` to be undriven, or choose to drive
  `a` equivalently to one of the explicitly specified case expressions.
- `a = a;` - As the new value is not specified, do not change `a`.
  A synthesis tool may produce a latching circuit.

## Rule: `default_nettype_none`

### Hint

Place `` `default_nettype none`` at the top of source code.

### Reason

Compiler directive `` `default_nettype none`` detects unintentional implicit wires.

### Pass Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
`default_nettype none
module M;
endmodule
```

### Pass Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
/* svlint off default_nettype_none */
module M;
endmodule
/* svlint on default_nettype_none */
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The `` `default_netype`` compiler directive can be used to specify the net type
of implicit nets, i.e. where a signal is referenced, or assigned to, without
being declared.
IEEE1800-2017 clause 22.8 stipulates "When no `` `default_nettype`` directive
is present or if the `` `resetall`` directive is specified, implicit nets are of
type `wire`."

SystemVerilog makes a distinction between variables (only 0 or 1 drivers)
and nets (0 or more drivers).
IEEE1364-2001 (Verilog) uses variables as abstractions for data storage
elements (`reg`, `integer`, `real`, `time`, `realtime`).
In contrast, IEEE1800-2017 (SystemVerilog) the distinction between nets and
variables is defined by how a simulator must calculate a value.
In a simulator, a variable stores a value, but a net's value is calculated by
evaluating the strength of all drivers.
To keep compatibility with Verilog, the default net type of an undeclared net
in SystemVerilog is `wire` (a net, not a variable), which requires evaluating a
list of values with strengths, rather than simply looking up a value.
The distinction between data storage elements and physical wires is therefore
made in using `always_comb`, `always_ff`, and (less commonly) `always_latch`
keywords.

Variables are preferred over nets for most digital logic for 2 reasons:
- Only 0 or 1 drivers allowed, so an accidental multi-driving is caught by
  a compile time error.
- Simulator performance (dependent on implemetation).
  Value can be found by lookup, rather than evaluation of drivers.

When `` `default_nettype none`` is used, all signals must be declared, thus
forcing the author to consider whether they mean a variable or a net.

See also:
- **inout_with_tri** - Useful companion rule.
- **input_with_var** - Useful companion rule.
- **output_with_var** - Useful companion rule.

The most relevant clauses of IEEE1800-2017 are:
- 6.5 Nets and variables
- 22.8 default nettype

Note: One prominent paper (Cliff Cummings, HDLCON 2002) recommends *against*
using `` `default_nettype none`` on the basis that concise, typeless code has
fewer opportunities for mistakes.
This attitude was popular at the time, e.g. Python's dynamic typing, but
modern attitudes are now favouring explicit types, e.g. Python's new type
checking syntax and tooling.
Additionally, the reasoning behind this guideline only applies principally to
IEEE1364, but not strongly to IEEE1800.

## Rule: `enum_with_type`

### Hint

Specify an explicit `enum` base type.

### Reason

The default `enum` base type is `int` (32b, 2-state).

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  typedef enum int {
    i
  } E;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  typedef enum
    { i
    } E;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

SystemVerilog has both 2-state types (each bit can take the values 0 or 1),
and 4-state types (each bit can take the values 0, 1, x, or z).
2-state types are useful for holding constants, and programming
non-synthesizable simulation constructs.
4-state types are useful for modelling physical hardware because undriven,
multiply-driven, or improperly-driven wires can hold unknown states that
cannot be sufficiently modelled by only 2 states.
Therefore, it is important to use the 4-state types when writing SystemVerilog
which will be used to infer physical hardware.

For example, a counter described as
`always_ff @(posedge clk) count_q <= count_q + 'd1;`
should be declared like `logic [4:0] count_q;`.
This infers 5 non-reset flip-flops where the initial value is unknown, and in a
4-state simulation the value of `count_q` is always unknown (`'x`, because
there's no initialization).
Instead, if it was declared as `bit [4:0] count_q;`, then the initial value
is `5'd0`, so a simulation will show `count_q` changing on every positive
edge of `clk`.
When describing physical hardware, it would be useful to know that the inferred
flip-flops have no reset, i.e., you want to be *able* to see x's when a mistake
is made even if you don't want to see x's.

An `enum` is a set of named values of a single type.
If no datatype is specified, then the default `int` (32b, 2-state) is implied.
For example, `enum {RED, BLACK} m; assign m = foo ? BLACK : RED;`
describes a multiplexor, but a simulator is unable to sufficiently model the
behavior of `m` when the value of `foo` is unknown.
A more appropriate declaration is
`typedef enum int {RED, BLACK} color; integer m;`.

Note: Comparison of 4-state variables against 2-state constants/enums *is*
appropriate, e.g. `logic a; a = (m == RED);`.

## Rule: `eventlist_comma_always_ff`

### Hint

Use `or` event expression separator instead of comma in `always_ff`.

### Reason

Consistent separators enhance readability.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge arst) q <= d;

  always_ff @( a
            or b
            or c
            ) q <= d;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge clk, posedge arst) q <= d;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(a
            , b
            , c
            ) q <= d;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (3 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge a or posedge b, c, d or e) q <= d;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Require the `or` keyword as the event expression separator instead of the comma
character (`,`) in `always_ff` processes, for cosmetics/readability and
potential textual conversion to Verilog95.

SystemVerilog allows for two synonymous separators (`or` and `,`) in event
control sensitivity lists.
The separators may be mixed freely, as shown in the following examples from
IEEE1800-2017 page 218.

```systemverilog
always @(a, b, c, d, e)
always @(posedge clk, negedge rstn)
always @(a or b, c, d or e)
```

The first released standard of Verilog (IEEE1364-1995) allows only the `or`
keyword as a separator in sensitivity lists.
Perhaps realising that other types of lists required the comma separator,
subsequent releases of Verilog (IEEE1364-2001 and IEEE1364-2005) and all
versions of SystemVerilog allow the use of either separator.
It can be visually jarring for readers to parse lists with more than one
separator, thus impairing readabilty.
Therefore, this rule requires that only one type of separator is used, i.e.
forbidding the use of the comma separator.

The advantage of requiring `or` rather than `,` in the sensitivity list of
`always_ff` processes is that a codebase may be converted from SystemVerilog to
Verilog95, with a simple text-replacement of `always_ff` to `always`.
Naturally, the rest of the codebase must contain only Verilog95-compatible
syntax for that conversion to be worthwhile.
This rule only applies to event expressions in `always_ff` processes.

## Rule: `eventlist_or`

### Hint

Use comma event expression separator instead of `or`.

### Reason

Consistent separators enhance readability.

```systemverilog
module M;
  initial begin
    z = y;
    @(posedge a, negedge b, edge c or d)
    z = x;
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Require the comma character (`,`) as the event expression separator instead of
the `or` keyword, for cosmetics/readability.

SystemVerilog allows for two synonymous separators (`or` and `,`) in event
control sensitivity lists.
The separators may be mixed freely, as shown in the following examples from
IEEE1800-2017 page 218.

```systemverilog
always @(a, b, c, d, e)
always @(posedge clk, negedge rstn)
always @(a or b, c, d or e)
```

The first released standard of Verilog (IEEE1364-1995) allows only the `or`
keyword as a separator in sensitivity lists.
Perhaps realising that other types of lists required the comma separator,
subsequent releases of Verilog (IEEE1364-2001 and IEEE1364-2005) and all
versions of SystemVerilog allow the use of either separator.
It can be visually jarring for readers to parse lists with more than one
separator, thus impairing readabilty.
Therefore, this rule requires that only one type of separator is used, i.e.
forbidding the use of the `or` separator.

The advantage of requiring `,` rather than `or` is that sensitivity lists look
the same as every other type of list which the reader's eye will be better
trained to read.
This rule applies to event expressions in any context, not only `always_ff`
processes.

## Rule: `explicit_case_default`

### Hint

Add a `default` arm to the `case` statement.

### Reason

Fully-specified case clarifies design intent.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    case (x)
      1: y = 0;
      default: y = 0;
    endcase

  always_ff @(clk)
    case (x)
      1: y = 0;
      default: y = 0;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    case (x)
      1: a = 0; // Incompletely specified case implies memory.
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(clk) begin
    case (x)
      1: a = 0;
      default: a = 0; // Explicit default arm is good.
    endcase

    case (y)
      1: b = 0; // Implicit default arm.
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The reasoning behind this rule are different between combinatial constructs
(`always_comb`, `always @*`) vs sequential constructs (`always_ff`,
`always_latch`).
The reasoning behind this rule is equivalent to that of **explicit_if_else**.

For combinational constructs, the reasoning behind this rule is equivalent to
that of the rule **case_default**.
To summarize, an incompletely-specified case statement may infer sequential
behavior (i.e. memory), thus causing a mismatch between simulation and synthesis
tools.
Due to the slightly different formulations, it is recommended that both this
rule and **case_default** are enabled.

For sequential constructs, the reasoning behind this rule is equivalent to
those of the rules **sequential_block_in_always_ff** and
**sequential_block_in_always_latch**.
To summarize, fully-specified case statements make the design intent explicit
and clear through some useful redundancy.

NOTE: The legacy keyword `always` can infer both combinational and sequential
constructs in the same block, which can be confusing and should be avoided.
Use of the legacy keyword can be detected with the rule **legacy_always**.

## Rule: `explicit_if_else`

### Hint

Add an `else` clause to the `if` statement.

### Reason

Fully-specified conditional clarifies design intent.

  always_ff @(clk)
    if (x) y <= 0;
    else   y <= z;

  always_comb
    if (x) y = 0;
    else   y = z;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    if (x) y = 0; // Incompletely specified condition implies memory.
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(clk) begin
    if (a)
      b <= c;
    else // Explicit else clause is good.
      b <= d;

    if (b)
      c <= d; // Implicit else clause.
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The reasoning behind this rule are different between combinatial constructs
(`always_comb`, `always @*`) vs sequential constructs (`always_ff`,
`always_latch`).
The reasoning behind this rule is equivalent to that of **explicit_case_default**.

For combinational constructs, the reasoning behind this rule is equivalent to

## Rule: `function_same_as_system_function`

### Hint

Rename `function` to something other than the name of a built-in function.

### Reason

Name clashes may cause confusion amongst tools and readers.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  function my_clog2;
  endfunction
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  function clog2;
  endfunction
endmodule
```

### Explanation

IEEE1800-2017 provides a variety of built-in functions, which must be
implemented in simulation and synthesis tools.
This rule is designed to catch (possibly incorrect) re-implementations of these
functions which may have different behavior and confuse readers.
Additionally, some tools may (wrongly) confuse user-defined functions with the
built-in system of the same name (except of the leading `$`) which may lead
to inconsistent results between tools.

## Rule: `function_with_automatic`

### Hint

Add the `automatic` lifetime specifier to function.

### Reason

Static lifetime of function items causes a simulation/synthesis mismatch.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  function automatic F;
  endfunction
endmodule

module automatic M; // Default lifetime.
  function F;
  endfunction
endmodule

interface automatic I;
  function F;
  endfunction
endinterface

program automatic P;
  function F;
  endfunction
endprogram

package automatic P;
  function F;
  endfunction
endpackage

module static M;
  function automatic F; // Override default lifetime.
  endfunction
endmodule

interface static I;
  function automatic F;
  endfunction
endinterface

program static P;
  function automatic F;
  endfunction
endprogram

package static P;
  function automatic F;
  endfunction
endpackage

module M;
  class C;
    function F; // Function in class is automatic.
    endfunction
  endclass
endmodule

    function F;
    endfunction
  endclass
endmodule

module static M;
  class C;
    function F;
    endfunction
  endclass
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  function F;
  endfunction
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Functions defined within a module, interface, program, or package default to
being static, with all declared items being statically allocated.
These items shall be shared across all uses of the function executing
concurrently.
This causes a mismatch between simulation and synthesis.

Functions can be defined to use automatic storage by using the `automatic`
keyword as part of the function declaration, i.e. in simulation each use of a
function is allocated dynamically for each concurrent function call.
This behavior can be accurately inferred in synthesis.

## Rule: `genvar_declaration_in_loop`

### Hint

Declare `genvar` inside a loop generate construct.

### Reason

Minimized `genvar` scope makes code easier to read and review.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  for(genvar i=0; i < 10; i++) begin: a
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  genvar i;
  for (i=0; i < 10; i++) begin
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The specification of genvar declarations in IEEE1800-2017 is not
straightforward.
The formal syntax of `genvar_initialization` specified in Annex A.4.2 (Generated
instantiation) suggests that the `genvar` keyword is optional, but the second
sentence of Clause 27.5 declares that
"The loop index variable shall be declared in a genvar declaration prior to
its use in a loop generate scheme".
All 5 examples in Clause 27.4 (Loop generate constructs) declare the genvars
outside of the generate loops, and the formal syntax of `genvar_declaration` in
A.2.1.3 (Type declarations) is only applicable to declarations outside of
loop generate constructs.
That is, using syntax like `genvar i; for (i=0; ...)`.
However, several examples of declarations inside loop generate constructs are
present in other areas of the LRM like `for (genvar i=0; ...`:
- Clause 11.12 Let construct, example d, page 295.
- Clause 16.14.6.1 Arguments to procedural concurrent assertions, page 464.
- Clause 20.11 Elaboration system tasks, page 607.
- Clause 23.3.3.5 Unpacked array ports and arrays of instances, page 717.

Although it is not explicitly stated, a reasonable interpretation is that a
genvar declared inside a generate loop may only be used within that specific
loop generate construct, i.e. locally scoped.
This interpretation matches C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999), while a requirement for
the genvar to be declared outside would match ANSI C (ISO/IEC 9899:1990).
This rule checks that genvars are declared in a C99-like style so that the
identifier is declared beside its use which has several advantages:
- The purpose of the genvar is immediately clear, e.g. it is easy to read
  that the `i` in `for (genvar i=0; i < N_BITS; i++) ...` refers to a bit
  index.
  In contrast, `genvar j; ...many lines... for (j=0; j < N_BITS; j++) ...`
  requires the reader to keep `j` in their head for a longer time.
- Only one comment is necessary, rather than splitting or duplicating the
  information.
- When a future revision of your code removes a generate loop, the genvar
  declaration is implictly removed too, which avoids lingering useless and
  distracting statements.
- A subsequent generate loop cannot accidentally use a "leftover" genvar
  which is intended for use only by a previous generate loop.
  The LRM only requires that "A genvar shall not be referenced anywhere other
  than in a loop generate scheme.".

Given the lack of clarity in the LRM, it is unsurprising that some tools might
not support both ways of declaring genvars, so the related rule
**genvar_declaration_out_loop** assumes a stricter interpretation of the LRM
and checks that declarations must be separate from the generate loop syntax.

## Rule: `genvar_declaration_out_loop`

### Hint

Declare `genvar` outside the loop generate construct.

### Reason

Some tools don't support `genvar` declarations inside loop generate constructs.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  genvar i;
  for (i=0; i < 10; i++) begin: a
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  for (genvar i=0; i < 10; i++) begin: l_foo
  end: l_foo
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The specification of genvar declarations in IEEE1800-2017 is not
straightforward.
The formal syntax of `genvar_initialization` specified in Annex A.4.2 (Generated

This rule assumes a strict interpretation of the LRM and checks that
declarations must be separate from the generate loop syntax.

The related rule **genvar_declaration_in_loop** checks the opposite way because
C99-like declarations inside loop generate constructs can lead to code which is

## Rule: `inout_with_tri`

### Hint

Specify `tri` datakind on `inout` ports.

### Reason

Explicit datakind of bi-directional ports should be consistent with input ports.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( inout tri a
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( inout wire a
  );
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This check mandates that each `inout` port must be explicitly declared as a
tri-state net, rather than the default nettype.

The rules for determining port kind, datatype, and direction are specified in
IEEE1800-2017 Clause 23.2.2.3 and facilitate various shorthand notations which
are backwards compatible with the semantics of Verilog (IEEE1364-1995):
- `inout a` -> `inout tri logic a` The implicit datatype is `logic` and the
  default nettype is `tri` (without overriding via the `` `default_nettype ``
  compiler directive).
- `inout wire a` -> `inout tri logic a` Again, using the implicit datatype of
  `logic`;
  As `wire` is an alias for `tri`, this is equivalent to the above example.
- `inout logic a` -> `inout tri logic a` This time using an explicit datatype
  (`logic`) but relying on the default nettype for its datakind.
- `inout wire logic a` -> `inout tri logic a` Again, even with an explicit
  datatype (`logic`), the `wire` keyword is simply an alias for the datakind
  `tri`.

When the default nettype is overridden to none, i.e. with the compiler
directive `` `default_nettype none ``, inout ports require an explicit
datakind.

Although the semantics of `inout a` are equivalent in IEEE1364-1995, the intent
is not clearly described.
An author should use `inout` to declare ports which are driven both internally
and externally, but `input` to declare ports which should only be driven
externally.
In order to describe the intended bi-directional behavior, `inout` ports must
be declared with an explicit `tri` datakind.

## Rule: `input_with_var`

### Hint

Specify `var` datakind on `input` ports.

### Reason

Default datakind of input port is a tri-state net.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( input var a
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( input logic a
  );
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This check mandates that each `input` port must be explicitly declared as a
variable, rather than the default nettype.

The rules for determining port kind, datatype, and direction are specified in
IEEE1800-2017 Clause 23.2.2.3 and facilitate various shorthand notations which
are backwards compatible with the semantics of Verilog (IEEE1364-1995):
- `input a` -> `input tri logic a` The implicit datatype is `logic` and the
  default nettype is `tri` (without overriding via the `` `default_nettype ``
  compiler directive).
- `input wire a` -> `input tri logic a` Again, using the implicit datatype of
  `logic`;
  As `wire` is an alias for `tri`, this is equivalent to the above example.
- `input logic a` -> `input tri logic a` This time using an explicit datatype
  (`logic`) but relying on the default nettype for its datakind.
- `input wire logic a` -> `input tri logic a` Again, even with an explicit
  datatype (`logic`), the `wire` keyword is simply an alias for the datakind
  `tri`.

When the default nettype is overridden to none, i.e. with the compiler
directive `` `default_nettype none ``, input ports require an explicit
datakind.

Although the semantics of `input a` are equivalent in IEEE1364-1995, the intent
is not clearly described.
An author should use `input` to declare ports which should only be driven
externally, and `inout` to declare ports which may also be driven internally.
In order to describe the intended uni-directional behavior, `input` ports must
be declared with an explicit `var` datakind, thus requiring the compiler to
check that the input is not driven from within the module (and if so, emit an
error).

## Rule: `interface_port_with_modport`

### Hint

Specify the modport on the interface port.

### Reason

Without a modport, the interface port signals are all implictly `inout`.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( test_if.a a
  , interface.b b
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( test_if a
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( interface b
  );
endmodule
```

### Explanation

A SystemVerilog Interface (SVI) defines a set of named signals which can be
used in many places within a design.
For example, if modules `A` and `B` both instance an interface `I` as `A.u_I`
and `B.u_I`, then both modules get their own collection of named signals,
accessed like `u_I.x`.
Each interface instance is separate, so `A.u_I.x` is independent of `B.u_I.x`.
By adding another signal `y` to the interface, two new signals are created,
`A.u_I.y` and `B.u_I.y`.

SVIs are useful for connecting hierarchical modules with a minimal amount of
code, i.e. by using interface ports.
To specify the direction of signals in an SVI, a `modport` is declared with
and identifier and the directions of each signal declared from the perspective
of inside a module.
Without a `modport`, the default direction of interface port signals is
`inout`.
This is often undesirable for synthesizable digital designs, so this rule
requires that each interface port includes a modport identifier.

## Rule: `keyword_forbidden_always`

### Hint

Use `always_comb`/`always_ff`/`always_latch` instead of `always`.

### Reason

General-purpose `always` cannot detect combinatorial/stateful (non-)blocking mistakes.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always @* begin
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

In Verilog (IEEE1364), there are two language constructs which can be used to
model combinatorial logic:
1. Continuous assignment to `wire` signals is specified with the `assign`
  keyword.
2. `reg` signals are assigned to with an `always` block, which is evaluated
  whenever anything in the sensitivity list changes value.

The `always` keyword can also be used for modelling sequential logic by
including the edge of a signal in the sensitivity list.

The semantics of these keywords in SystemVerilog are compatible with Verilog,
but additional keywords (`always_comb`, `always_ff`, and `always_latch`) should
be used to clarify intent of digital designs.
The `always_*` keywords have slightly different semantics which are beneficial
for synthesizable designs:
1. `always_*` processes require compiler checks that any signals driven on the
  LHS are not driven by any other process, i.e. `always_*` cannot infer
  multi-driven or tri-state logic.
2. `always_comb` processes require a compiler check that the process does not
  infer state.
3. `always_ff` processes require a compiler check that the process does infer
  state.

This rule forbids the use of the general-purpose `always` keyword, thus forcing
authors of synthesizable design code to clarify their intent.
In verification code to be used in simulation only, a general-purpose `always`
process is a valid and useful way of scheduling events.
Therefore, this rule is intended only for synthesizable design code, not for
testbench code.

The alternative rule **level_sensitive_always** has similar reasoning but is
slightly relaxed, requiring that `always` blocks have an explicit sensitivity
list including an edge.
It is possible to construct a full-featured testbench where all `always` blocks
meet that requriment.
Therefore, it is appropriate to use **keyword_forbidden_always** on
synthesizable design code, but on verification code use
**level_sensitive_always** instead.

## Rule: `keyword_forbidden_generate`

### Hint

Remove `generate`/`endgenerate` keywords.

### Reason

Keywords `generate`/`endgenerate` do not change semantics of generate blocks.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  generate
  endgenerate
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The `generate`/`endgenerate` keywords may be used in a module, interface,
program, or checker to define a generate region.
A generate region is a textual span in the module description where generate
constructs may appear.
Use of generate regions is optional.
There is no semantic difference in the module when a generate region is used.
A parser may choose to recognize the generate region to produce different error
messages for misused generate construct keywords.

As the semantics of generate blocks are unchanged by the
`generate`/`endgenerate` keywords, the keywords can be argued to be visual
noise, simply distracting the reader.
Therefore, this rule is designed to detect and forbid their use.

NOTE: Some non-compliant tools may require the use of these keywords, which
provides an argument against this rule.

## Rule: `keyword_forbidden_priority`

### Hint

Remove `priority` keyword, perhaps replace with an assertion.

### Reason

Priority-case/if constructs may mismatch between simulation and synthesis.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  initial
    case (a)
      default: b = 1;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  initial
    priority case (a)
      default: b = 1;

endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  initial
    priority if (a)
      b = 1;
    else if (a)
      b = 2;
    else
      b = 3;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The keyword `priority` may be used on `if`/`else` or `case` statements to
enable *violation checks* in simulation, and describe design intent for
synthesis.

A `priority if` statement without an explicit `else` clause will produce a
*violation report* in simulation if the implicit `else` condition is matched.
A `priority if` statement with an explicit `else` clause cannot produce a
violation report.
In synthesis, the `priority` keyword makes no difference to an `if`/`else`
statement, because the semantics of bare `if`/`else` statements already imply
priority logic.

A `priority case` statement without a `default` arm will produce a
violation report in simulation if the `default` condition is matched.
A `priority case` statement with an explicit `default` arm cannot produce a
violation report.
In synthesis, the `priority` keyword indicates that the designer has manually
checked that all of the possible cases are specified in the non-default arms.
This is equivalent to the use of the informal `full_case` directive comment
commonly seen in older Verilog code.

Violation checks only apply in simulation, not in synthesized hardware, which
allows for mismatches to occur.
For example, where violation reports are produced but ignored for whatever
reason, but the simulation does not otherwise check for the erroneous
condition, the synthesis tool may produce a netlist with the invalid assumption
that the condition cannot be met.

## Rule: `keyword_forbidden_unique`

### Hint

Remove `unique` keyword, perhaps replace with an assertion.

### Reason

Unique-case/if constructs may mismatch between simulation and synthesis.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)

module M;
  initial
    case (a)
      default: b = 1;

      b = 1;
    else if (a)
      b = 2;
    else
      b = 3;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The keyword `unique` may be used on `if`/`else` or `case` statements to
enable *violation checks* in simulation, describe design intent for synthesis,
and change the semantics of condition priority.

A `unique if` statement without an explicit `else` clause will produce a
*violation report* in simulation if the implicit `else` condition is matched,
or more than one `if` conditions are matched.
A `unique if` statement with an explicit `else` clause will produce a violation
report when more than one of the `if` conditions are matched.
Thus, the conditions in a `unique if` statement may be evaluated in any order.
A `unique case` statement will produce a violation report if multiple arms
match the case expression.

In synthesis, the `unique` keyword on an `if`/`else` statement specifies that
priority logic (between the conditions) is not required - a significant change
in semantics vs a bare `if`/`else` statement.
Similarly, priority logic is not required between arms of a `unique case`
statement.
The `unique` keyword indicates that the designer has manually checked that
exactly 1 of the specified conditions must be met, so all conditions may be
safely calculated in parallel.
This is equivalent to the use of the informal `parallel_case` and `full_case`
directive comments commonly seen in older Verilog code.

In simulation, after finding a uniqueness violation in a `unique if`, the
simulator is not required to evaluate or compare the rest of the conditions.
However, in a `unique case`, all case item expressions must be evaluated even
once a matching arm is found.
These attributes mean that the presence of side effects, e.g. `$display()` or
`foo++`, may cause non-deterministic results.

Violation checks only apply in simulation, not in synthesized hardware, which
allows for mismatches to occur.
For example, where violation reports are produced but ignored for whatever
reason, but the simulation does not otherwise check for the erroneous
condition, the synthesis tool may produce a netlist with the invalid assumption
that the conditions can be safely evaluated in parallel.

## Rule: `keyword_forbidden_unique0`

### Hint

Remove `unique0` keyword, perhaps replace with an assertion.

### Reason

Unique0-case/if constructs may mismatch between simulation and synthesis.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  initial
    case (a)
      default: b = 1;
    endcase

### Fail Example (1 of 2)

      b = 1;
    else if (a)
      b = 2;
    else
      b = 3;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The keyword `unique0` may be used on `if`/`else` or `case` statements to
enable *violation checks* in simulation, describe design intent for synthesis,
and change the semantics of condition priority.

A `unique0 if` statement will produce a *violation report* in simulation if
more than one `if` condition is matched.
Thus, the conditions in a `unique0 if` statement may be evaluated in any order.
In synthesis, the `unique0` keyword specifies that priority logic (between the
conditions) is not required - a significant change in semantics vs a bare
`if`/`else` statement.

In synthesis, the `unique0` keyword on an `if`/`else` statement specifies that
priority logic (between the conditions) is not required - a significant change
in semantics vs a bare `if`/`else` statement.
Similarly, priority logic is not required between arms of a `unique0 case`
statement.
The `unique0` keyword indicates that the designer has manually checked that
exactly 0 or 1 of the specified conditions must be met, so all conditions may
be safely calculated in parallel.
This is equivalent to the use of the informal `parallel_case` and `full_case`
directive comments commonly seen in older Verilog code.

In simulation, after finding a uniqueness violation in a `unique0 if`, the
simulator is not required to evaluate or compare the rest of the conditions.
However, in a `unique0 case`, all case item expressions must be evaluated even
once a matching arm is found.

## Rule: `keyword_forbidden_wire_reg`

### Hint

Replace `wire` or `reg` keywords with `logic`, `tri` and/or `var`.

### Reason

Explicit datatype `logic` and/or datakind `var`/`tri` better describes intent.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  logic a;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  wire a;
  reg b;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The keywords `wire` and `reg` are present in SystemVerilog primarily for
backwards compatibility with Verilog (IEEE1364-1995).
In SystemVerilog, there are additional keywords, such as `logic` and `tri`
with more refined semantics to better express the programmer's intent.

The LRM covers the use of `wire`:

> The net types `wire` and `tri` shall be identical in their syntax and
> functions; two names are provided so that the name of a net can indicate the
> purpose of the net in that model.

The LRM covers the use of `reg`:

> The keyword `reg` does not always accurately describe user intent, as it
> could be perceived to imply a hardware register. The keyword `logic` is a
> more descriptive term. `logic` and `reg` denote the same type.

## Rule: `level_sensitive_always`

### Hint

Replace level-sensitive `always` with `always_comb`.

### Reason

Level-sensitive `always` cannot detect combinatorial/stateful (non-)blocking mistakes.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
  end
  always @(posedge a) begin
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always @* begin // No sensitivity list.
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always @ (a or b) begin // No sensitivity to posedge, negedge, or edge.
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

In Verilog (IEEE1364), there are two language constructs which can be used to
model combinatorial logic:
1. Continuous assignment to `wire` signals is specified with the `assign`
  keyword.
2. `reg` signals are assigned to with an `always` block, which is evaluated
  whenever anything in the sensitivity list changes value.

The `always` keyword can also be used for modelling sequential logic by
including the edge of a signal in the sensitivity list.

The semantics of these keywords in SystemVerilog are compatible with Verilog,
but additional keywords (`always_comb`, `always_ff`, and `always_latch`) should
be used to clarify intent of digital designs.
The `always_*` keywords have slightly different semantics which are beneficial
for synthesizable designs:
1. `always_*` processes require compiler checks that any signals driven on the
  LHS are not driven by any other process, i.e. `always_*` cannot infer
  multi-driven or tri-state logic.
2. `always_comb` processes require a compiler check that the process does not
  infer state.
3. `always_ff` processes require a compiler check that the process does infer
  state.

This rule requires that general-purpose `always` blocks have an explicit
sensitivity list which includes at least one edge, thus forcing the use of
`assign` or `always_comb` to specify combinatorial logic.
It is possible to construct a full-featured testbench where all `always` blocks
meet that requriment.
The alternative rule **keyword_forbidden_always** has similar reasoning but is
more strict, completely forbidding the use of general-purpose `always` blocks.
It is appropriate to use **keyword_forbidden_always** on synthesizable design
code, but on verification code use **level_sensitive_always** instead.

## Rule: `localparam_explicit_type`

### Hint

Provide an explicit type in `localparam` declaration.

### Reason

Explicit parameter types clarify intent and improve readability.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam int A = 0;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam L = 0;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The type of a parameter is more fundmental to express intent than its value.
By analogy, asking a shopkeeper for "5 oranges" is more likely to be correctly
understood than simply asking for "5" without clarification.
This rule requires that authors consider and specify the type of each
`localparam` elaboration-time constant.
Explicit types help readers to understand exactly what effects the constant
might have, thus reducing the effort they need to expend reading how the
parameter is used.

Without an explicit type, a localparam will take a type compatible with its
constant expression.
Implict types can thereby introduce discrepencies between what the author
intends and how tools interpret the code.
For example, interactions between the default datatype `logic`, constant
functions, and case expressions can result in mismatches between simulation and
synthesis.
A detailed investigation into the semantics of implicit vs explicit types
on SystemVerilog `parameter` and `localparam`s can be found in a tutorial
paper here:

## Rule: `localparam_type_twostate`

### Hint

Declare `localparam` with an explicit 2-state type.

Design constants with Xs or Zs may cause simulation/synthesis mismatch.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam byte     A = 8'b0;
  localparam shortint B = 16'b0;
  localparam int      C = 32'b0;
  localparam longint  D = 64'b0;
  localparam bit      E = 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Fail Example (3 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam reg C = 1'b0; // 1b
endmodule
```

### Explanation

In order to avoid subtle bugs related to 2-state vs 4-state types and
X-propagation, constants should be declared with an explicit 2-state type.
Separately, all synthesizable signals should be declared with an explicit
4-state type so that a simulation can detect unknown values (Xs).
For complex types such as nested packed structs, that means you need two
versions of each type: a 2-state version for constants, and a 4-state version
for signals.
The need for this rule stems from the fact that SystemVerilog includes the
concepts of both equivalence and partial equivalence, with interactions between
2-state and 4-state structure members which invite mismatching behavior
between simulation and synthesis.

The relevant quote about implicit conversion of packed structure members from
2-state to 4-state is found on page 140 of IEEE1800-2017:
If all datatypes within a packed structure are 2-state, the structure as a
whole is treated as a 2-state vector.
If any datatype within a packed structure is 4-state, the structure as a whole
is treated as a 4-state vector.
If there are also 2-state members in the structure, there is an implicit
conversion from 4-state to 2-state when reading those members and from 2-state
to 4-state when writing them.

For constants of simple datatypes, it is trivial to visually check that their
values do not contain Xs or Zs.
However, for constants of more complex datatypes, e.g. nested packed
structures, the use of constant functions may infer Xs as (accidentally)
unassigned members will take their default values.
Default values are specified in IEEE1800-2017 Table 6-7.
This can be particularly subtle when a single member of a deeply nested packed
struct is wrongly declared with a 4-state type, e.g. `logic`, thus forcing all
other (previously 2-state) members to have a default value of `'X` instead of
the expected `'0`.

The equivalence operators ("case" equality/inequality) are written as 3
characters each (`===`, `!==`) and can only return false or true,
e.g. `4'b01XZ === 4'b01XZ` -> `1'b1` (true).
The partial equivalence operators ("logical" equality/inequality) are written
as 2 characters each (`==`, `!=`) and may return false, true, or unknown,
e.g. `4'b01XZ === 4'b01XZ` -> `1'bx` (unknown).

Let `w` be a 4-state signal which a systhesis tool will implement with a
collection of wires.
Let `c2` and `c4` be constants with 2-state and 4-state types respectively.
Without loss of generality, only the case/logical equality operators are
required to demonstrate troublesome expressions.

- `w === c2` Result may be false (`1'b0`), true (`1'b1`).
  If `w` contains any Xz or Zs, then the result is false (`1'b0`).
  This is *not* desired behavior as Xs in `w` are hidden and simulation is
  likely, but not certain, to mismatch synthesized hardware.
- `w === c4` Result may be false (`1'b0`), true (`1'b1`).
  If `w` contains any Xz or Zs, then the result is is true iff the constant
  `c4` has been defined with corresponding Xs and Zs.
  Comparison between unknown and unknown is all but certain, to mismatch
  synthesized hardware.
- `w == c2` Result may be false (`1'b0`), true (`1'b1`), or unknown (`1'bX`).
  If `w` contains any Xs or Zs, then the result is unknown.
  This is desired behavior as it sufficiently models synthesized physical
  hardware.
- `w == c4` Result may be false (`1'b0`), true (`1'b1`), or unknown (`1'bX`).
  If `c4` contains any Xs or Zs, then the result will always be unknown.
  While that may be noticed early in simulation, unwitting designers may be
  tempted to prevent X-propagation on the result, thus hiding any issues with
  Xs or Zs on `w`.

The use of 4-state constants with wildcard equality operators is a slightly
different usecase.
If wildcard equality operators are used with 4-state constants in your code,
this rule should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

NOTE: The reasoning behind this rule invites the use of other rules:
1. Check that members of a packed structure definition are either all 2-state
  or all 4-state.
2. Check for the use of case equality operators.
3. Check that functions are not declared with a 4-state type.

## Rule: `loop_statement_in_always_comb`

    else
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        a = b[i] + 5;

endmodule
```

### Explanation

The SystemVerilog language is specified in terms of simulation and allows
procedural statements to be used in both combinational (`always_comb`)
and sequential (`always_ff`, `always_latch`) logic processes.
The specification of logic with procedures facilitates straightforward
translation of algorithms which are previously modelled as procedures, e.g. an
algorithm described in a paper and demonstrated with a Python reference model.
Logic specified with procedures is also (often) synthesizable which makes this
a powerful language feature for quickly building a proof-of-concept
implementation, perhaps on an FPGA.
However, this language feature has several downsides for designs which are to
be trusted with large amounts of investment:
- Visualizing the expected logic with a schematic may be very difficult, thus
  leading to problems with routing and verification.
- Trivial-looking code can produce enormously complex logic.
- Trivial-looking changes can easily result in vastly different outcomes from
  synthesis.

A good mantra for synthesizable design is: If you find it easy to draw a
detailed schematic, then a synthesis tool will most likely produce a good
solution quickly.
For a production-worthy design, where you want to have full confidence in your
understanding of how the code works under all the various tools (synthesis,
LEC, simulation, formal proof, etc.), using only combinatial code to specifiy
combinational logic reduces the risk of mis-interpretations by different tools.
This is the same line of reasoning behing the `sequential_block_in_always_*`
rules.

### Explanation

The SystemVerilog language is specified in terms of simulation and allows
procedural statements to be used in both combinational (`always_comb`)
and sequential (`always_ff`, `always_latch`) logic processes.
The specification of logic with procedures facilitates straightforward
translation of algorithms which are previously modelled as procedures, e.g. an
algorithm described in a paper and demonstrated with a Python reference model.
Logic specified with procedures is also (often) synthesizable which makes this
a powerful language feature for quickly building a proof-of-concept
implementation, perhaps on an FPGA.
However, this language feature has several downsides for designs which are to
be trusted with large amounts of investment:
- Visualizing the expected logic with a diagram may be very difficult, thus
  leading to problems with routing and verification.
- Trivial-looking code can produce enormously complex logic.
- Trivial-looking changes can easily result in vastly different outcomes from
  synthesis.

## Rule: `loop_statement_in_always_latch`

### Hint

Keywords `for` is forbidden within `always_latch`.

### Reason

Procedural loops within `always_latch` introduce sequential dependencies.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;

  for (genvar i = 0; i < 5; i++) begin
    if (0 == i) begin
      always_latch if (load) a[0] <= f();
    end else begin
      always_latch if (load) a[i] <= a[i-1] + 5;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;

  always_latch
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
      if (0 == i)
        a <= f();
      else
        a = a + 5;

endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;

  always_latch
    if (x)
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        a[i] <= a + 5;

## Rule: `loop_variable_declaration`

### Hint

Declare the loop variable within the loop, i.e. `for (int i`.

### Reason

Minimizing the variable's scope avoids common coding errors.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  initial
    for(int i=0; i < 10; i++) begin
    end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  initial begin
    int i;
    for(i=0; i < 10; i++) begin
    end
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

A loop variable may be declared either inside the loop, e.g.
`for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)`, or outside the loop, e.g.
`int i; ... for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)`.
This rule mandates that the scope of a loop variable, e.g. `i`, is minimized to
avoid a common class of coding mistake where `i` is erroneously used outside
the loop.

## Rule: `multiline_for_begin`

### Hint

Add `begin`/`end` around multi-line `for` statement.

### Reason

Without `begin`/`end`, the loop statement may be confusing.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
    for (int a=0; a < 10; a++) begin
      a = 0;
    end

    for (int a=0; a < 10; a++) a = 0;
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
    for (int i=0; i < 10; i++)
      a = 0;
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
    for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) a = 0; // This is okay.

    for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) // Catch any for-loop, not only the first.
      a = 0;
  end
endmodule
```

writes something different.

## Rule: `multiline_if_begin`

### Hint

Add `begin`/`end` around multi-line `if` statement.

### Reason

Without `begin`/`end`, the conditional statement may be confusing.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
    if (a) begin
        a = 0;
    end

    if (a) begin
        a = 0;
    end else if (a) begin
        a = 0;
    end

    if (a) begin
        a = 0;
    end else if (a) begin
        a = 0;
    end else begin
        a = 0;
    end

    if (a) a = 0;
    else if (a) a = 0;
    else a = 0;
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 5)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    if (a)
      a = 0; // Missing begin/end.
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 5)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    if (a) begin
      a = 0;
    end else if (a)
      a = 0; // Missing begin/end.
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (3 of 5)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    if (a) begin
      a = 0;
    end else if (a) begin
      a = 0;
    end else
      a = 0; // Missing begin/end.
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (4 of 5)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
    if (a)
      a = 0; // Missing begin/end.
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (5 of 5)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
    if (a) a = 0; // This conditional statement is okay.
    else if (a) a = 0;
    else a = 0;

    if (a)   // Check all if-statements, not only the first.
      a = 0; // Missing begin/end.

## Rule: `non_ansi_module`

### Hint

Declare `module` header in ANSI style.

### Reason

Non-ANSI module headers are visually noisy and error-prone.

### Pass Example (1 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M      // An ANSI module has ports declared in the module header.
  ( input  a
  , output b
  );
endmodule
```

### Pass Example (2 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M;     // A module with no ports is also ANSI.
endmodule
```

### Pass Example (3 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M      // Declaring ports in the header with default direction (inout)
  ( a         // also specifies an ANSI module.
  , b
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( a
  , b
  );
  input  a;   // Declaring ports outside the module header declaration
  output b;   // makes this a non-ANSI module.
endmodule
```

### Explanation

There are two ways to declare a module header in SystemVerilog:
1. ANSI style - newer, neater, more succinct, compatible with IEEE1364-2001.
2. non-ANSI style - additionally compatible with older Verilog (IEEE1364-1995).

Examples of both styles are given in IEEE1364-2001 (e.g. pages 180 vs 182) and
IEEE1800-2017 (e.g. pages 702 vs 700).

The non-ANSI style separates the declaration of ports, their direction, and
their datatype.
In addition to requiring more text, and visual noise, to convey the same
information, the non-ANSI style encourages simple coding mistakes where
essential attributes may be forgotten.
This rule requires that module headers are declared using the ANSI style.

## Rule: `non_blocking_assignment_in_always_comb`

### Hint

Remove non-blocking assignment in `always_comb`.

### Reason

Scheduling between blocking and non-blocking assignments is non-deterministic.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    x = 0;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    x <= 0;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Simulator event ordering between blocking and non-blocking assignments
is undefined, so observed behavior is simulator-dependent.
This rule forbids the use of non-blocking assigments (using the `<=` operator)
in `always_comb` blocks.
Instead, use the blocking assignment operator `=`.

An excellent paper detailing the semantics of Verilog blocking and non-blocking
assignments is written by Clifford E Cummings and presented at SNUG-2000,
"Nonblocking Assignments in Verilog Synthesis, Coding Styles that Kill".

## Rule: `operator_case_equality`

### Hint

Use logical equality instead of case equality.

### Reason

Case equality operations are not generally synthesizable.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_latch if (a == b) z = y;

  always_comb z = (a != b) ? y : x;

  always_latch if (a ==? b) z = y;

  always_comb z = (a !=? b) ? y : x;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_latch if (a === b) z = y;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb z = (a !== b) ? y : x;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Case equality operations (using `===` or `!==` operators) include comparison
against `'z` or `'x`, so they are not generally synthesisable.
Synthesizable code should use logical or wildcard equality operations instead.

## Rule: `output_with_var`

### Hint

Specify `var` datakind on `output` ports.

### Reason

Explicit datakind of output ports should be consistent with input ports.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( output var logic a
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( output logic a
  );
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This check mandates that each `output` port must be explicitly declared as a
variable, rather than the default nettype or implict datakind.

The rules for determining port kind, datatype, and direction are specified in
IEEE1800-2017 Clause 23.2.2.3 and facilitate various shorthand notations which
are backwards compatible with the semantics of Verilog (IEEE1364-1995):
- `output a` -> `output tri logic a` The implicit datatype is `logic` and the
  default nettype is `tri` (without overriding via the `` `default_nettype ``
  compiler directive).
- `output wire a` -> `output tri logic a` Again, using the implicit datatype of
  `logic`;
  As `wire` is an alias for `tri`, this is equivalent to the above example.
- `output wire logic a` -> `output tri logic a` Again, even with an explicit
  datatype (`logic`), the `wire` keyword is simply an alias for the datakind
  `tri`.
- `output logic a` -> `output var logic a` This time the datakind is implicit,
  but the datatype is *explicit*, so the inferred datakind is `var`.

When the datatype is implicit and the default nettype is overridden to none,
i.e. with the compiler directive `` `default_nettype none ``,  output ports
require an explicit datakind.

Although the semantics of `output a` are equivalent in IEEE1364-1995, the
intent is not clearly described, and the difference to `output logic a` is
unintuitive.
An author should use `output` to declare ports which should only be driven
internally, and `inout` to declare ports which may also be driven externally.
In order to describe the intended uni-directional behavior, `output` ports must
be declared with an explicit `var` datakind, thus requiring the compiler to
check that the output is only driven from within the module (otherwise, emit an
error).

## Rule: `parameter_default_value`

### Hint

Specify `parameter` with an explicit default value.

### Reason

Default values are required by some tools and clarify intent.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter int P = 0
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter int P // Type is specified (good), but default value isn't (bad).
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter Q // Neither type or default value are specified (very bad).
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (3 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter int P = 0
  , R // Legal, but even less clear about the author's intention.
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Explanation

It is legal for parameters declared in a parameter port list to omit
a default value (an elaboration-time constant), thus setting to parameter value
to the default value of its type when not overridden.
This language feature can be used by module authors to force integrators to
choose an override value, by ensuring that the default is invalid.

```systemverilog
module M #(parameter int NE0) ();
  if (0 == NE0) $error("MUST_OVERRIDE must not be zero.");
endmodule

module Parent ();
  M u_bad (); // This causes elaboration error.
  M #(NE0=1) u_good ();
endmodule
```

The example above uses a system elaboration task to explicitly force an
elaboration error, but there are several ways to implictly cause elaboration
errors.
Relying on the type's default value can cause problems for two reasons:
1. Some tools do not support this syntax.
2. Simply omitting the default value is unclear about the author's intention,
  particularly when the type is also omitted.

This rule checks that all parameter ports have an explicit default value.

## Rule: `parameter_explicit_type`

### Hint

Provide an explicit type in `parameter` declaration.

### Reason

Explicit parameter types clarify intent and improve readability.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter int a = 0
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter a = 0
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 2)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter a = int'(0)
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The type of a parameter is more fundmental to express intent than its value.
By analogy, asking a shopkeeper for "5 oranges" is more likely to be correctly
understood than simply asking for "5" without clarification.
This rule requires that authors consider and specify the type of each
module `parameter` port.
Explicit types help readers, particularly large-scale integrators, to
understand exactly what values are expected, thus reducing the effort they need
to expend reading how the parameter is used.

Without an explicit type, a module parameter will take a type compatible with
its default assignment, or a type compatible with any override values.
Implict types can thereby introduce discrepencies between what the author
intends and how tools interpret the code.
For example, interactions between the default datatype `logic`, constant
functions, and case expressions can result in mismatches between simulation and
synthesis.
A detailed investigation into the semantics of implicit vs explicit types
on SystemVerilog `parameter` and `localparam`s can be found in a tutorial

## Rule: `parameter_in_generate`

### Hint

Replace `parameter` keyword with `localparam`.

### Reason

In a generate block, `localparam` properly describes the non-overridable semantics.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  for (genvar i=0; i < 5; i++) begin
    localparam int P1 = 1;
  end

  if (1) begin
    localparam int P2 = 2;
  end else begin
    localparam int P3 = 3;
  end

  case (1)
    0: begin
      localparam int P4 = 4;
    end
    default: begin
      localparam int P5 = 5;
    end
  endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  for (genvar i=0; i < 5; i++) begin
    parameter int P1 = 1;
  end

  if (1) begin
    parameter int P2 = 2;
  end else begin
    parameter int P3 = 3;
  end

  case (1)
    0: begin
      parameter int P4 = 4;
    end
    default: begin
      parameter int P5 = 5;
    end
  endcase
endmodule
```

### Explanation

In the context of a generate block, the `parameter` keyword is a synonym for
the `localparam` keyword.
This rule encourages the author to consider that the constant may not be
overridden and convey that explictly.

## Rule: `parameter_in_package`

### Hint

Replace `parameter` keyword with `localparam`.

### Reason

In a package, `localparam` properly describes the non-overridable semantics.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
package P;
  localparam int A = 1;
endpackage
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
package P;
  parameter int A = 1;
endpackage
```

### Explanation

In the context of a package, the `parameter` keyword is a synonym for the
`localparam` keyword.

## Rule: `parameter_type_twostate`

### Hint

Declare `parameter` with an explicit 2-state type.

### Reason

Design constants with Xs or Zs may cause simulation/synthesis mismatch.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter byte     A = 8'b0
  , parameter shortint B = 16'b0
  , parameter int      C = 32'b0
  , parameter longint  D = 64'b0
  , parameter bit      E = 1'b0
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter integer A = 32'b0
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter logic B = 1'b0
  ) ();
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (3 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(parameter reg C = 1'b0
  , logic         Z = 1'b0 // TODO: Z isn't caught.
  ) ();
endmodule
```

## Rule: `sequential_block_in_always_comb`

### Hint

Keywords `begin` and `end` are forbidden within `always_comb`.

### Reason

Sequential blocks within `always_comb` introduce sequential dependencies.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    a = b;

  always_comb
    if (x)
      a = b;
    else
      a = c;

  always_comb
    case (x)
      one:     a = x;
      two:     a = y;
      default: a = z;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 4)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb begin
    a = z;
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 4)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    if (bar) begin
      b = z;
    end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (3 of 4)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    if (bar) c = z;
    else begin
      c = z;
    end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (4 of 4)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    case (bar)
      one: begin
        d = z;
      end
      two: d = z;
      default: d = z;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule has two purposes:
1. Prevent mismatches between simulation and synthesis.
2. Avoid unnecessarily restricting the simulator's scheduler.

An `always_comb` block is scheduled for execution whenever any of the RHS
variables (or nets) change value, which can lead to unnecessary sequential
dependencies.
For example, the following block is requires that the "expensive" (in terms
of CPU time) function must be called to update `a` whenever `z` changes value,
in addition to whenever `y` changes value.
```systemverilog
always_comb begin
  a = expensive(y);
  b = z;
end
```

The above example can be reformed to allow the simulator more flexibility in
how it schedules processes.
Logical equivalence is maintained, and a synthesis tool will interpret these
examples equivalently.
Note that continuous assignment (using `assign`) is not sensitive to changes in
`y` because functions are not transparent.
```systemverilog
always_comb a = expensive(y);
assign b = z;
```

This rule is intended for synthesisable code only, not testbench code.
Testbenches often necessarily rely on sequential dependencies, but a synthesis
tool for digital synchronous logic will produce a netlist without sequential
dependencies.
That can lead to a mismatch between simulation and synthesis.

## Rule: `sequential_block_in_always_ff`

### Hint

Keywords `begin` and `end` are forbidden within `always_ff`.

### Reason

Sequential blocks within `always_ff` may encourage overly-complex code.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    q <= d;

  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    if (x) q <= d;

  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    if (rst) q <= 0;
    else     q <= d;

  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    case (foo)
      one:     q <= x;
      two:     r <= y;
      default: s <= z;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 4)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    a <= z;
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 4)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    if (x) begin
      a <= z;
    end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (3 of 4)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    if (x) a <= z;
    else begin
      a <= z;
    end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (4 of 4)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    case (x)
      foo: begin
        a <= z;
      end
      bar: a <= z;
      default: a <= z;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The consequences/purposes of this rule are perhaps subtle, particulaly in how
it works with companion rules **default_nettype_none**, **explicit_case_default**,
**explicit_if_else**, **style_indent**, and a guideline to avoid `for` within
`always_ff`.

In conjunction with these companion rules and guidelines, a nice consequence is
that editing code after the fact is "safe", i.e. not error prone.
Without `begin`/`end` adding another statement to a single-statement conditional
block may be error prone.
This is why coding styles for C-style languages often forbid writing
`if (a) foo;`, instead requiring `if (a) { foo; }` - because it's easy to forget
to add braces with an additional statement like `if (a) { foo; bar; }`.
While a simple rule is to require the use of `begin` and `end` (or `{` and `}`),
this introduces visual noise.
The goal is to guard programmers from making a simple and easy mistake.
This rule, in conjunction with the companion rules, achieves the same goal using
a different approach, in addition to providing other nice properties.

With a sequential block (marked by `begin` and `end`) you can assign to multiple
signals in a leaf conditon which can easily result in difficult-to-comprehend
logic, e.g.:
```systemverilog
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
  if (cond) begin
    foo_q <= foo_d;       // Block was originally written for foo.
    bar_q <= bar_d;       // This was added later.
  end
  bar_q <= bar_d;         // What happens to bar_q?
end
```
By forbidding sequential blocks, you enforce that exactly signal is assigned to
per leaf condition.
A nice consequence is that exactly one signal is updated on each evaluation of
the `always_ff` block.
IEEE1800-2017 specifies that if a signal is assigned to in an `always_ff` block,
then it shall not be assigned to by any other block (compile error).

An example with multiple signals in the `always_ff` is a ping-pong buffer (AKA
shunt buffer, storage of a 2-entry fifo).
Due to the construction, you can be sure that you never update both entries at
the same time, except when that is clearly explicit.
```systemverilog
  // Enforced exclusive updates, with reset and clockgate.
  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    if (rst)
      {ping_q, pong_q} <= '0; // Assignment to multiple signals is explicit.
    else if (clkgate)
      if (foo) ping_q <= foo;
      else     pong_q <= foo;
    else // Optional explicit else.
      {ping_q, pong_q} <= {ping_q, pong_q};
```

Another example with multiple signals is an address decoder.
Due to the construction, you can be sure that you aren't accidentally updating
multiple registers on a write to one address.
```systemverilog
  // Enforced exclusivity of address decode.
  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    if (write)
      case (addr)
        123:        red_q   <= foo;
        456:        blue_q  <= foo;
        789:        green_q <= foo;
        default:    black_q <= foo; // Optional explicit default.
      endcase
```

When you don't need those exclusivity properties, only one signal should be
updated per `always_ff`.
That ensures that the code doesn't get too deep/complex/unintuitive and
drawing a logical diagram is straightforward.
This is the expected form for most signals.
```systemverilog
  always_ff @(posedge clk)
    if (rst)          ctrl_q <= '0;
    else if (clkgate) ctrl_q <= ctrl_d;
    else              ctrl_q <= ctrl_q; // Optional explicit else.
```

## Rule: `sequential_block_in_always_latch`

### Hint

Keywords `begin` and `end` are forbidden within `always_latch`.

### Reason

Sequential blocks within `always_latch` may encourage overly-complex code.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_latch
    if (foo) a <= b;

  always_latch
    if (foo) b <= y;
    else     b <= z;

  always_latch
    case (foo)
      one:     a <= x;
      two:     b <= y;
      default: c <= z;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 4)

    a <= z;
  end
endmodule
```

        a <= z;
      end
      bar: a <= z;
      default: a <= z;
    endcase
endmodule
```

### Explanation

The explanation of **sequential_block_in_always_ff**, and much of the explanation
of **sequential_block_in_always_comb**, also applies to this rule.
Main points are that avoiding `begin`/`end` helps protect the programmer against
simple mistakes, provides exclusivity properties by construction, and avoids
restricting simulator scheduling decisions.

# Naming Convention Rules

Rules for checking against naming conventions are named with either the suffix
`_with_label` or one of these prefixes:

- `prefix_`
- `(lower|upper)camelcase_`
- `re_(forbidden|required)_`

Naming conventions are useful to help ensure consistency across components in
large projects.
A naming convention might be designed with several, sometimes competing, points
of view such as:

- Enable simple identification of code's owner, e.g. "Prefix all module
  identifiers with `BlueTeam_` at the point of declaration".
  This makes it easy for the blue team to review their own code, without being
  distracted by other team's code.
  Not specific to SystemVerilog, i.e also applicable to VHDL.
- Enhance readability of netlists, e.g. "Prefix all module instances with `u_`,
  interface instances with `uin_`, and generate blocks with `l_`".
  This facilitates straightforward translation from a netlist identifier to its
  corresponding identifier in SystemVerilog.
  Not specific to SystemVerilog, i.e also applicable to VHDL.
- Enhance readability of code for integrators and reviewers, e.g. "Prefix all
  ports with `i_`, `o_`, or `b_` for inputs, outputs, and bi-directionals
  respectively".
  This allows a reader to glean important information about how ports and
  internal logic are connected without the need to scroll back-and-forth
  through a file and/or memorize the portlist.
- Add redundancy to capture design intent, e.g. "Suffix every signal which
  should infer a flip-flop with `_q`".
  By using conventional terminology (`d` for input, `q` for output) readers
  will be alerted to investigate any flip-flops without this prefix as the
  tools may not be treating the code as the original author intended.
  Some example suffixes include:
  - `_d`: Input to a flip-flop.
  - `_q`: Output from a flip-flop.
  - `_lat`: Output from a latch.
  - `_mem`: Memory model.
  - `_a`: Asynchronous signal.
  - `_n`: Active-low signal.
  - `_dp`, `_dn`: Differential positive/negative pair.
  - `_ana`: Analog signal.
  - `_55MHz`: A signal with a required operating frequency.
- On the above two points, prefixes are redundant re-statements of information
  which must is explicit in SystemVerilog semantics, and suffixes are redundant
  clarifications of information which can only be specified implictly in
  SystemVerilog.

The rules `re_forbidden_*` can also be used to restrict language features.
For example, if a project requires that interfaces must never be used, you can
enable the rule `re_forbidden_interface` and configure it to match all
identifier strings.
By forbidding all possible identifiers at the point of declaration, no
interfaces may be specified.
For example:
```toml
[option]
re_forbidden_interface = ".*"

[rules]
re_forbidden_interface = true
```

## Rule: `generate_case_with_label`

### Hint

Use a label with prefix "l_" on conditional generate block.

### Reason

Unnamed generate blocks imply unintuitive hierarchical paths.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)

      logic b = 1'b0;

      logic c = 1'b0;
    end: foo              // NOTE: With optional label on end.
    default: begin: bar
      logic c = 1'b0;
    end                   // NOTE: Without optional label on end.
  endcase
endmodule
```

  case (2'd4)             // Without default arm.
    2'd1: begin: foo
      logic e = 1'b0;
    end
  endcase
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (5 of 5)
```systemverilog

  case (2'd5)             // Without non-default arm.
    default: begin: bar
      logic f = 1'b0;
    end
  endcase
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Conditional generate constructs select zero or one blocks from a set of
alternative generate blocks within a module, interface, program, or checker.
The selection of which generate blocks are instantiated is decided during
elaboration via evaluation of constant expressions.
Generate blocks introduce hierarchy within a module, whether they are named or
unnamed.
Unnamed generate blocks are assigned a name, e.g. `genblk5`, which other tools
can use and depend on.
For example, to find a specific DFF in a netlist you could use a hierarchical
path like `top.genblk2[3].u_cpu.genblk5.foo_q`.
The naming scheme for unnamed generated blocks is defined in
IEEE1800-2017 clause 27.6.

These implicit names are not intuitive for human readers, so this rule is
designed to check three things:
1. The generate block uses `begin`/`end` delimiters.
2. The generate block has been given a label, e.g. `begin: mylabel`.
3. The label has an appropriate prefix, e.g. `begin: l_mylabel` starts with
  the string `l_`.

The prefix is useful to when reading hierarchical paths to distinguish between
module/interface instances and generate blocks.
For example, `top.l_cpu_array[3].u_cpu.l_debugger.foo_q` provides the reader
with more useful information than `top.genblk2[3].u_cpu.genblk5.foo_q`.

### Explanation

A loop generate construct allows a single generate block to be instantiated
multiple times within a module, interface, program, or checker.
The selection of which generate blocks are instantiated is decided during
elaboration via evaluation of constant expressions.
Generate blocks introduce hierarchy within a module, whether they are named or
unnamed.
Unnamed generate blocks are assigned a name, e.g. `genblk5`, which other tools
can use and depend on.
For example, to find a specific DFF in a netlist you could use a hierarchical
path like `top.genblk2[3].u_cpu.genblk5.foo_q`.

### Explanation

Conditional generate constructs select zero or one blocks from a set of
alternative generate blocks within a module, interface, program, or checker.
The selection of which generate blocks are instantiated is decided during
elaboration via evaluation of constant expressions.
Generate blocks introduce hierarchy within a module, whether they are named or
unnamed.
Unnamed generate blocks are assigned a name, e.g. `genblk5`, which other tools
can use and depend on.
For example, to find a specific DFF in a netlist you could use a hierarchical
path like `top.genblk2[3].u_cpu.genblk5.foo_q`.
The naming scheme for unnamed generated blocks is defined in
IEEE1800-2017 clause 27.6.

These implicit names are not intuitive for human readers, so this rule is
designed to check three things:
1. The generate block uses `begin`/`end` delimiters.
2. The generate block has been given a label, e.g. `begin: mylabel`.
3. The label has an appropriate prefix, e.g. `begin: l_mylabel` starts with
  the string `l_`.

The prefix is useful to when reading hierarchical paths to distinguish between
module/interface instances and generate blocks.
For example, `top.l_cpu_array[3].u_cpu.l_debugger.foo_q` provides the reader
with more useful information than `top.genblk2[3].u_cpu.genblk5.foo_q`.

- **generate_for_with_label** - Similar reasoning, useful companion rule.
- **prefix_instance** - Useful companion rule.

The most relevant clauses of IEEE1800-2017 are:
- 27.5 Conditional generate constructs
- 27.6 External names for unnamed generate blocks

## Rule: `lowercamelcase_interface`

### Hint

Begin `interface` name with lowerCamelCase.

### Reason

Naming convention simplifies audit.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
interface fooBar;
endinterface
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
interface FooBar;
endinterface
```

### Explanation

There are 3 usual types of SystemVerilog file for synthesizable design code
(module, interface, package) and having a simple naming convention helps
distinguish them from a filesystem viewpoint.
In Haskell, types/typeclasses must start with an uppercase letter, and
functions/variables must start with a lowercase letter.
This rule checks part of a related naming scheme where modules and interfaces
should start with a lowercase letter, and packages should start with an
uppercase letter.

## Rule: `prefix_inout`

### Hint

Prefix `inout` port identifier with "b_".

### Reason

Port prefixes help readers to follow signals through modules.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( inout var b_foo
  , input var logic [FOO-1:0] b_bar
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( inout var foo // `foo` is missing prefix.
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (2 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( inout var logic [A-1:0] bar // `bar` is missing prefix, not `A`.
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (3 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( inout var i_foo
  , inout var bar // `bar` is missing prefix.
  );
endmodule
```

### Explanation

There are 4 kinds of SystemVerilog port (`inout`, `input`, `output`, and `ref`),
though `ref` is not generally used for synthesisable code.
For a new reader, unfamiliar with a large module, it is useful to be able to
distinguish at a glance between which signals are ports and internal ones.
This is especially useful for an integrator who needs to read and understand the
boundaries of many modules quickly and accurately.
To use a visual analogy, prefixing port names is like adding arrowheads to a
schematic - they're not essential, but they speed up comprehension.
This rule requires the prefix `b_` (configurable) on bi-directional signals,
i.e, ports declared with direction `inout`, which is also the default direction.

## Rule: `prefix_instance`

### Hint

Prefix instance identifier with "u_".

### Reason

Naming convention helps investigation using hierarchical paths.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  I #() u_foo (a, b, c);
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  Foo #() foo (a, b, c);
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule requires that instances of modules or interfaces are prefixed with
`u_` (configurable) which allows readers to quickly find instances and
connections of interest.
Prefixing instances also allows components of a hierarchical path to be easily
identified as modules/interfaces rather than generate blocks, which is
especially useful when reading netlists and synthesis reports.
The default value of `u_` comes from the historical use of `U` for the PCB
reference designator of an inseparable assembly or integrated-circuit package,
as standardized in IEEE315-1975.

## Rule: `re_required_instance`

### Hint

Use an instance identifier matching regex `^[a-z]+[a-z0-9_]*$`.

### Reason

Identifiers must conform to the naming scheme.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  A #(
  ) mn3 (); // Identifier matches default required regex (lowercase).
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  A #(
  ) Mn3 (); // Identifier doesn't match default required regex (lowercase).
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Instances must have identifiers matching the regex configured via the
`re_required_instance` option.

NOTE: For performance reasons, particularly within text-editor integrations
(i.e. svls), the `re_(required|forbidden)_` should only be used where the
simpler naming rules are not sufficient.

### Explanation

There are 3 usual types of SystemVerilog file for synthesizable design code
(module, interface, package) and having a simple naming convention helps
distinguish them from a filesystem viewpoint.
In Haskell, types/typeclasses must start with an uppercase letter, and
functions/variables must start with a lowercase letter.
This rule checks part of a related naming scheme where modules and interfaces
should start with an uppercase letter, and packages should start with an
lowercase letter.

# Style/Whitespace Convention Rules

Most rules for checking style/whitespace are named with the prefix `style_`,
but `tab_character` is also in this class.
These rules do not reference any clause in the LRM (IEEE1800-2017).


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Rule: `style_commaleading`

### Hint

Follow each comma with a single space (comma-leading format).

### Reason

Consistent style enhances readability.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  #(bit FOO = 1 // comment
  , int BAR = 2 /* comment */
  , bit [31:0] BAZ = 2
  )
  ( input  var logic i_abc // comment
  , output var logic o_ghi /* comment */
  );

  assign {foo, bar} =
    { i_abc
    , 12'h345
    , b_def     // comment
    , 16'h3456  /* comment */
    };

  assign singleline2D = {{foo, bar}, {foo, bar}, {foo, bar}};

  function F
    ( input a
    , input b
    );
  endfunction
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  #( bit FOO = 1 // Space after `#(` causes misalignment.
  , int BAR = 2
  ,  bit [31:0] BAZ = 2 // Too many spaces after comma.
  )
  (input  var logic i_abc // Missing space after `(` causes misalignment.
  ,output var logic o_ghi // Missing space after comma.
  );

  assign {foo, bar} = { // One-line style is okay.
      i_abc
    ,12'h345 // Missing space.
    ,  b_def // Too many spaces after comma.
    };

  function foo
  (input a // Missing space after `(` causes misalignment.
  ,  input b // Too many spaces after comma.
  );
  endfunction

endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule is intended to enforce consistent formatting of comma-separated lists
such as parameter/signal port declarations, concatenations, assignment
patterns, and function arguments.
The rule is very simple: Each comma must be followed by exactly 1 space.

Comma-leading style is seen extensively in other languages, e.g. Haskell, and
lends itself well to SystemVerilog, as seen in the following examples.
```systemverilog
/* Module declaration without parameter ports.
*/
module Mod_A
  ( input  var logic i_abc // comment
  , inout  tri logic b_def /* comment */
  , output var logic o_ghi
  );
endmodule

/* Module declaration with parameter ports.
*/
module Mod_B
  #(int FOO = 1 // comment
  , bit BAR = 2 /* comment */
  , bit [31:0] BAZ = 2
  , parameter int BUZZ = 4
  )
  ( input  var logic i_abc // comment
  , inout  tri logic b_def /* comment */
  , output var logic o_ghi
  );


  /* Each item on its own line.
  - Short lines.
  - Every list indented to same level.
  - Single-line LHS can be any length without indent issue.
  */
  assign {foo, bar} =
    { i_abc
    , 12'h345
    , b_def     // comment
    , 16'h3456  /* comment */
    };


  /* Everything can fit on one line.
  - No space after opening parenthesis/bracket/brace.
  */
  assign singleline1D = {i_abc, 12'h345, b_def, 16'h3456};
  assign singleline2D = {{foo, bar}, {foo, bar}, {foo, bar}};

  /* Multi-dimensional concatenation with innermost array on one line.
  */
  assign matrix2D_A =
    { {elem21, elem20}
    , {elem11, elem10} // comment
    , {elem01, elem00} /* comment */
    };
  assign matrix3D_A =
    { { {elem211, elem210}
      , {elem201, elem200}

## Rule: `style_indent`

### Hint

Follow each newline with an integer multiple of 2 spaces.

### Reason

Consistent indentation is essential for readability.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  if (a)
    a = 0;
  else
    a = 1;
  // comment
/*
  comment
*/
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
 if (a)
   a = 0;
   else
     a = 1;
   // comment
/*
 comment
   */
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Consistent indentation is essential for efficient reading by your human
colleagues.
This rule simply checks that any newline (outside of string literals) is
followed by an integer multiple of 2 (configurable) space characters.

## Rule: `style_keyword_0or1space`

### Hint

Follow keyword with a symbol or exactly 1 space.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  function F;
    if (a)
      return; // semicolon immediately after `return`.
    else
      return a; // 1 space then expression after `return`.
  endfunction
endmodule

```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  function F();
    if (a)
      return  ; // Multiple spaces after `return`.
  endfunction
endmodule

```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following the `return` keyword.
The `return` keyword can be used without an argument for void functions, in
which case there should be no space between the keyword and the following
symbol, i.e. `return;`.
The `return` keyword can also be used with an argument, in which case there
should be exactly 1 space between the keyword and the following identifier,
e.g. `return foo;`.

## Rule: `style_keyword_0space`

### Hint

Remove all whitespace between keyword and following symbol.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    case (a)
      123:
        b = c;
      default: // no space between `default` and colon.
        b = d;
    endcase

  function F;
    for (;;)
      if (a)
        break; // no space between `break` and semicolon.
  endfunction
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb
    case (a)
      123:
        b = c;
      default : // Space between `default` and colon.
        b = d;
    endcase
  function foo ();
    for (;;)
      if (a) break  ; // Spaces between `break` and semicolon.
  endfunction
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following these keywords:
`break`
, `continue`
, `default`
, `null`
, `super`
, and `this`.
Uses of these keywords should never have any whitespace between the keyword and
the following symbol, e.g.
`break;`,
, `continue;`
, `default:`
, `(myexample == null)`
, or `super.foo`.

## Rule: `style_keyword_1or2space`

### Hint

Follow keyword with exactly 1 or 2 spaces.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( input a
  , inout b  // 1 space after `input` or `inout` keywords
  , output c // makes port identifiers unaligned.

  , input  d
  , inout  e // 2 spaces after `input` or `inout` keywords
  , output f // makes port identifiers aligned.
  );
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M
  ( input   a
  , inout   b // multiple spaces after `input` or `inout` keywords
  );
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following the `inout` and `input`
keywords.
These keywords specify the direction of signal ports, and are frequently used
alongside the `output` keyword which is 1 character longer.
The suggested companion rule **style_keyword_1space** checks that `output` is
followed by a single space, and this rule allows `inout`/`input` to be followed
by a single space too.
However, it is common and visually appealing to have port definitions
vertically aligned, so this rule also allows 2 following spaces, e.g:
```systemverilog
module foo
  ( input  var logic i_foo // aligned, 2 spaces
  , output var logic o_bar
  , inout tri logic b_baz // unaligned, 1 space
  );
endmodule
```

      case (a)              // 1 space after `case`.
        1: foo <= bar;
      endcase

## Rule: `style_keyword_construct`

### Hint

Follow keyword with a newline or exactly 1 space.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb a = b;  // 1 space after `always_comb`.

  initial begin       // 1 space after `initial`.
    foo = bar;
  end

  always_latch
    if (a) b = c;     // newline after `always_latch`.
    else d = e;       // 1 space after `else`.

  final // 1 space then comment after `final`.
    foo = bar;
endmodule

```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  always_comb   a = b;  // Multiple spaces after `always_comb`.
  initial     begin       // Multiple spaces after `initial`.
    a = b;
  end
  always_latch
    if (a) b = c;
    else      d = e;  // Multiple spaces after `else`.
  final  // Multiple spaces then comment after `final`.
    a = b;
endmodule

```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following these keywords:
`always_comb`
, `always_latch`
, `assign`
, `else`
, `final`
, `generate`
, and `initial`.
These keyword open constucts and should always be followed by a newline,
exactly 1 space then another keyword/identifier, or exactly 1 space then a
comment, e.g:
```systemverilog
// Followed by 1 space then another keyword.
always_comb begin
  foo = '0;
  foo[0] = 5;
end

// Followed by 1 space then an identifier.
always_comb bar = 5;

// Followed by a newline.
always_comb
  if (x < y)
    z = 5;
  else // Followed by 1 space then this comment.
    z = 6;

// Assign to a concatenation.
assign // You could use `always_comb` instead.
  { foo
  , bar
  , baz[i][j][k]
  } = '0;
```

## Rule: `style_keyword_datatype`

### Hint

Follow datatype keyword with a symbol or exactly 1 space.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam bit A = 0;   // 1 space after `bit`.
  localparam int B = 0;   // 1 space after `int`.
  logic a;                // 1 space after `logic`.
  reg b;                  // 1 space after `reg`.
  wire b;                 // 1 space after `wire`.
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam bit  A = 0;  // Multiple spaces after `bit`.
  localparam int
    B = 0;                // Newline after `int`.
  logic // foo
    a;                    // Single-line comment after `logic`.
  reg /* bar */ b;        // Multi-line after `reg`.
  wire        c;          // Multiple spaces after `wire`.
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following these keywords:
`byte`
, `chandle`
, `event`
, `int`
, `integer`
, `logic`
, `longint`
, `real`
, `realtime`
, `ref`
, `reg`
, `shortint`
, `shortreal`

## Rule: `style_keyword_end`

### Hint

Follow keyword with a colon, newline, or exactly 1 space.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  initial begin
    if (foo) begin: l_foo
      a = b;
    end: l_foo           // colon immediately after `end`.

    if (foo) begin
      a = c;
    end else begin       // 1 space after `end`.
      a = d;
    end
//  ^^^ newline after `end`.
  end // 1 space then comment after `end`.
endmodule

```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  initial begin
    if (foo) begin: l_foo
      a = b;
    end   : l_foo           // Spaces between `end` and colon.

    if (foo) begin
      a = c;
    end   else begin       // Multiple spaces after `end`.
      a = d;
    end
  end   // Multiple spaces then comment after `end`.
endmodule

```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following the `end` keyword.
The keyword `end` always be followed by a newline,
exactly 1 space then another keyword, a colon, or exactly 1 space then a
comment, e.g:
```systemverilog
// Followed by a newline.
if (FOO) begin
  ...
end

// Followed by 1 space then a keyword.
if (FOO) begin
  ...
end else ...

// Followed by a colon.
if (FOO) begin: l_foo
  ...
end: l_foo

// Followed by a comment.
if (FOO) begin // {{{ An opening fold marker.
  ...
end // }}} A closing fold marker.
```

## Rule: `style_keyword_maybelabel`

### Hint

Follow keyword with a colon, newline, or exactly 1 space plus comment.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
endmodule: M // colon immediately after `endmodule`
package P;
    function F;
    endfunction
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^ newline after `endfunction`
endpackage // 1 space then comment after `endpackage`

```

### Fail Example (1 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M;
endmodule  : M // spaces immediately after `endmodule`
```

### Fail Example (2 of 3)
```systemverilog
package P;
endpackage  // multiple spaces then comment after `endpackage`
```

### Fail Example (3 of 3)
```systemverilog
interface I;
endinterface interface J; // space instead of newline after `endinterface`
endinterface
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following these keywords:
`begin`
, `endchecker`
, `endclass`
, `endclocking`
, `endconfig`
, `endfunction`
, `endgroup`
, `endinterface`
, `endmodule`
, `endpackage`
, `endprimitive`
, `endprogram`
, `endproperty`
, `endsequence`
, `endtask`
, `fork`
, `join`
, `join_any`
, and `join_none`.
These keywords are used to delimit code blocks and should always be followed by
a colon, a newline, or exactly 1 space then a comment, e.g:
```systemverilog
if (FOO) begin: l_foo // Followed by a colon.
  ...
end

module top;
  ...
endmodule: top  // Followed by a colon.

// Followed by a newline.
if (FOO) begin
  ...
end

if (FOO) begin // Followed by a comment.
  ...
end
```

## Rule: `style_keyword_new`

### Hint

Follow keyword with a newline or exactly 0 space.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
class Packet; // Example from IEEE1800-2017, page 174.
  integer command;

  function new(); // Constructor without arguments.
    command = IDLE;

### Fail Example (3 of 3)
```systemverilog
module M;
  C2 p3 = new// No space before comment.
    ( STARTUP
    , A_RATHER_LONG_CONSTANT_IDENTIFIER
    , 456
    );
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following the`new` keyword.
The class constructor keyword should always be followed by a newline,
exactly 0 spaces then a symbol, or exactly 1 space then a comment.

## Rule: `style_keyword_newline`

### Hint

Follow keyword with a newline or exactly 1 space plus comment.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  generate
    case (foo)
      123: a = b;
    endcase
//  ^^^^^^^ newline after `endcase`
  endgenerate // 1 space then comment after `endgenerate`
endmodule

```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  generate
    case (x)
      123: a = b;
    endcase if (x) a = b; // No newline after `endcase`.
  endgenerate   // Multiple spaces then comment after `endgenerate`.
endmodule

```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following these keywords:
, `endcase`
, `endgenerate`
, `endspecify`
, `endtable`
, `specify`
, and `table`.
These keywords are used to delimit code blocks and should always be followed by
a newline or exactly 1 space then a comment, e.g:
```systemverilog
case (FOO)
  ...
endcase // Followed by a comment.

// Followed by a newline.
case (FOO)
  ...
endcase
```

## Rule: `style_operator_arithmetic`

### Hint

Follow operator with a symbol, identifier, newline, or exactly 1 space.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam bit [a-1:0] P1 = b; // No space around `-`.

  localparam int P2 = a + b; // Single space around `+`.

  localparam int P3 =
    a *
    b; // Newline following `*`.

  localparam int P4 =
    a * // Single space then comment following `*`.
    b;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam int P2 = a  +  b; // Multiple spaces around `+`.

  localparam int P3 =
    a *

    b; // Multiple newlines following `*`.

  localparam int P4 =
    a *  // Multiple spaces then comment following `*`.
    b;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following any arithmetic operator:
`+`
, `-`
, `*`
, `/`
, `%`
, and `**`.
Uses of these operators may have a single space or newline between the
operator's symbol and the following symbol or identifier, e.g.
`a + b`,
, or `a+b`.

In relation to Annex A of IEEE1800-2017, this rule applies to the specific
variants of `binary_operator` specified in Table 11-3.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Rule: `style_operator_boolean`

### Hint

Follow operator with a exactly 1 space.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam bit P1 = a && b; // Single space around `&&`.

  localparam bit P2 = a < b; // Single space around `<`.

  for (genvar i=0; i < 5; i++) begin // Single space around `<`.
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam bit P1 = a&&b; // No space around `&&`.

  localparam bit P2 =
    a <
    b; // Newline after `<`.

  for (genvar i=0; i<5; i++) begin // No space around `<`.
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following any binary operator whose
operation returns a boolean:
`==`
, `!=`
, `===`
, `!==`
, `==?`
, `!=?`
, `&&`
, `||`
, `<`
, `<=`
, `>`
, `>=`
, `->`
, and `<->`.
Uses of these operators must have a single space between the operator's symbol
and the following symbol or identifier, e.g.
`a && b`,
, `c !== d`
, or `0 < 5`.

In relation to Annex A of IEEE1800-2017, this rule applies to specific variants
of `binary_operator` and `binary_module_path_operator`.

## Rule: `style_operator_integer`

### Hint

Follow operator with a newline or exactly 1 space.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam int P1 = a | b; // Single space around `|`.

  localparam int P2 =
    a &
    aMask; // Newline following `&`.

  localparam int P3 =
    a & // Single space then comment following `&`.
    aMask;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam int P1 = a|b; // No space around `|`.

  localparam int P2 =
    a &

    aMask; // Multiple newlines following `&`.

  localparam int P3 =
    a &  // Multiple spaces then comment following `&`.
    aMask;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following any binary operator whose
operation returns an integer (except arithmetic operators):
`&`
, `|`
, `^`
, `^~`
, `~^`
, `>>`
, `<<`
, `>>>`
, and `<<<`.
Uses of these operators must have single space or a newline between the
operator's symbol and the following symbol or identifier, e.g.
`1 << 5`,
, or `8'hAA | 8'h55`.

In relation to Annex A of IEEE1800-2017, this rule applies to specific variants
of `binary_operator` and `binary_module_path_operator`.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Rule: `style_operator_unary`

### Hint

Remove all whitespace following the operator.

### Reason

Consistent use of whitespace enhances readability by reducing visual noise.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam bit P1 = &{a, b}; // No space after `&`.

  for (genvar i=0; i < 5; i++) begin // No space after `++`.
  end
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  localparam bit P1 = & {a, b}; // No space after `&`.

  for (genvar i=0; i < 5; i++ ) begin // Space after `++`.
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

This rule checks the whitespace immediately following any unary operator:
`++`
, `--`
, `+`
, `-`
, `!`
, `~`
, `&`
, `~&`
, `|`
, `~|`
, `^`
, `~^`
, and `^~`.
Uses of these operators must never have any whitespace between the operator's
symbol and the following symbol or identifier, e.g.
`i++`,
`!FOO`,
, `&{a, b, c}`
, or `$info("%d", -5);`.

In relation to Annex A of IEEE1800-2017, this rule applies to all variants of
`unary_operator`, `unary_module_path_operator`, and `inc_or_dec_operator`.

## Rule: `style_trailingwhitespace`

### Hint

Remove trailing whitespace.

### Reason

Trailing whitespace leads to unnecessary awkwardness with version control.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module        M;
// End of line ^
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
                
// End of line ^
endmodule

module M;       
// End of line ^
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Trailing whitespace, i.e. space characters immediately followed by a newline,
lead to unnecessary differences in version control because some/many/most
developer's editors are setup to remove this on writing to disk.
This rule simply checks that any newline (outside of string literals) is
not immediately preceeded by a space character.

## Rule: `tab_character`

### Hint

Replace tab characters with spaces.

### Reason

Tabs may cause misalignment depending on editor setup.

### Pass Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
  logic a;
endmodule
```

### Fail Example (1 of 1)
```systemverilog
module M;
	logic a;
endmodule
```

### Explanation

Tab characters appear as different widths in dependent on editor/viewer setup,
leading to confusion for readers with a different setup.
Spaces are all but essential, but tabs are not, so this rule simply forbids the
use of tabs.

NOTE: `sv-parser`, the basis of svlint and svls requires files to be encoded
in UTF-8.
See `man iconv` for details on how to convert legacy encodings to UTF-8.

# Rulesets

Some pre-configured rulesets are provided in `rulesets/*.toml`.
A pre-configured ruleset can be used in the three standard ways (rename to
`.svlint.toml` and place in the project root, the `--config` argument, or via
the `SVLINT_CONFIG` environment variable).
Pre-configured rulesets reside in `rulesets/*.toml`.
There are two methods of specifying those TOML files:

1. Simply copy your existing `.svlint.toml` configuration into that directory.
  Ideally, add some comments to explain the background of the configuration and
  open a [pull request](https://github.com/dalance/svlint/pulls) to have it
  included as part of this project.
  This is the (initially) lower-effort approach, best suited to small personal
  projects with low requirements for documentation.
2. Create a definition in Markdown to compose a ruleset from a sequence of
  TOML fragments , i.e. write `md/ruleset-foo.md` to describe how the
  configuration in `rulesets/foo.toml` should be formed.
  Again, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/dalance/svlint/pulls)
  to have it included as part of this project.
  This approach is initially higher-effort but on larger projects, users will
  appreciate a good explanation of why configurations are necessary.

The rest of this section refers to the second method, which is a variant of
[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

If you only use one configuration, there isn't much benefit in having wrapper
scripts, i.e. the benefits appear when you regularly use several
configurations.
For example, say you work on two projects called "A" and "B", and each project
has its own preferences for naming conventions.
This situation can be troublesome because there are many ways to get confused
about which configuration file should be used on which files.
Wrapper scripts help this situation by providing convenient commands like
`svlint-A` and `svlint-B`.
Another case for convenient access to specific rulesets is where you want to
check that some files adhere to a particular set of rules, e.g. rules to
reduce synthesis/simulation mismatches should apply to `design/*.sv` but not
apply to `verif/*.sv`.

Each ruleset specification (in `md/ruleset-*.md`) is processed individually.
A ruleset specification is freeform Markdown containing codeblocks with TOML
(toml), POSIX shell (sh), or Windows batch (winbatch) language markers.
Each ruleset specifies exactly one TOML configuration, one POSIX shell script,
and one Windows batch script.
For example, let this ruleset specification be placed in
`md/ruleset-an-example.md`:

    This is freeform Markdown.

    Some explanation of how the **foo** and **bar** rules work together
    with the associated option **blue**.
    ```toml
    rules.foo = true
    rules.bar = true
    option.blue = "ABC"
    ```

    Next, some text about the **baz** rule and another option **red**.
    ```toml
    # A comment here.
    rules.baz = true
    option.red = "DEF"
    ```

    Maybe some more Markdown text here.

This example will produce three files under `rulesets/` when cargo builds this
crate: `an-example` (a POSIX shell script), `an-example.cmd` (a Windows batch
script), and `an-example.toml`.
A ruleset's TOML configuration is generated by concatenating all TOML
codeblocks into one file, so the above example will produce this TOML file:
```toml
rules.foo = true
rules.bar = true
option.blue = "ABC"
# A comment here.
rules.baz = true
option.red = "DEF"
```

POSIX shell scripts begin with this header, where "an-example" is replaced by
the ruleset's name:
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
set -e

# If flag/options are given that don't use the ruleset config, simply run
# svlint with the given arguments.
NONRULESET="-h|--help|-V|--version|--dump-filelist|-E|--example|--update"
if printf "%b\n" " $*" | grep -Eq " (${NONRULESET})";
then
  svlint $*
  exit $?
fi

SVLINT_CONFIG="$(dirname $(command -v svlint-an-example))/an-example.toml"

# Delete ANSI control sequences that begin with ESC and (usually) end with m.
# Delete ASCII control characters except line feed ('\n' = 0o12 = 10 = 0x0A).
SANS_CONTROL="| sed -e 's/\\o33\\[[0-9;]*[mGKHF]//g'"
SANS_CONTROL="${SANS_CONTROL} | tr -d '[\\000-\\011\\013-\\037\\177]'"

# Combine the above output sanitization fragments into variables which can be
# evaluated and processed with xargs, e.g:
#   eval "${SVFILES}" | xargs -I {} sh -c "grep foo {};"
# NOTE: Creating a variable with the result (instead of the command) would lead
# to undefined behavior where the list of file paths exceeds 2MiB.
SVFILES="svlint --dump-filelist=files $* ${SANS_CONTROL}"
SVINCDIRS="svlint --dump-filelist=incdirs $* ${SANS_CONTROL}"
```
Next, any codeblocks with the `sh` language marker are concatenated to
the header in order before, finally, this footer is appended:
```sh
env SVLINT_CONFIG="${SVLINT_CONFIG}" svlint $*
```
The final command calls the main `svlint` executable, wherever it is on your
`$PATH`, with the environment variable `SVLINT_CONFIG` pointing to a TOML
configuration in the same directory as the wrapper script.
Any command line arguments given to the wrapper script are passed on to the
main executable (via `$*`).
When svlint searches for a configuration (`src/main.rs::search_config()`), the
environment variable is chosen in preference to the `--config` flag which
prevents confusing cases:

1. Where the script is given the option, e.g. `svlint-foo --config=bar *.sv`.
  As the environment variable is set, the option `--config=bar` is ignored.
  If a user wishes to pass a different configuration, they'll need to call the
  main executable like `svlint --config=bar *.sv`.
2. Where the environment variable is not set or is invalid, the `--config`
  value (defaulting to `.svlint.toml`) is searched for hierarchically,
  beginning in the current directory then moving upwards to filesystem
  ancestors.

If instead the `--config` option was used in wrapper scripts, this could lead
to confusion where TOML files exist elsewhere in the hierarchy.

It isn't essential for all ruleset scripts to be POSIX compliant, but POSIX
compliance should be encourage because it allows for consistent behavior across
the widest range of systems.
The utilities used in the POSIX wrappers are specified in the current POSIX
standard (IEEE1003.1-2017, Volume 3: Shell and Utilities).

Windows batch scripts begin with this header, where "an-example" is replaced by
the ruleset's name:
```winbatch
@echo off
for /f %%E in ('where.exe /f svlint-an-example') do (
    set "SVLINT_CONFIG=%%~dpEan-example.toml"
)
```
Next, any codeblocks with the `winbatch` language marker are then concatenated
to the header in order before, finally, this footer is appended:
```winbatch
svlint %*
```

The batch script template is designed for Windows XP and later, using the
`cmd.exe` shell.
Some useful resources for Windows batch script commands:

- [`echo`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/echo)
- [`for`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/for)
- [`where`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/where)
- [`set`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1)

These wrapper scripts can then be used with svlint's usual arguments like
`svlint-foo path/to/design/*.sv`.
Note that this style of wrapper script allows you to use `$PATH` environment
variable in the usual way, and that the wrapper scripts will simply use the
first version of `svlint` found on your `$PATH`.

This method of generating a configuration and wrapper scripts enables full
flexibility for each ruleset's requirements, while encouraging full and open
documentation about their construction.
The process, defined in `src/mdgen.rs`, is deterministic so both the Markdown
specifications and the TOML configurations are tracked by versions control.
However, wrapper scripts are not installed alongside the `svlint` binary
created via `cargo install svlint` (or similar).
Instead, you must either add `rulesets/` to your `$PATH` environment variable,
or copy the wrapper scripts to somewhere already on your `$PATH`.

## Ruleset: *designintent*

Rules that forbid suspicious constructions, i.e. ways of specifying hardware
that are legal according to the LRM, but may express their intention unclearly.

This ruleset is a superset of **ruleset-simsynth**.
These rules don't depend on each other or interact to provide additional
properties.
```toml
rules.blocking_assignment_in_always_ff = true
rules.blocking_assignment_in_always_latch = true
rules.non_blocking_assignment_in_always_comb = true
rules.case_default = true
rules.enum_with_type = true
rules.function_with_automatic = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_priority = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_unique = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_unique0 = true
rules.level_sensitive_always = true # Redundant with keyword_forbidden_always.
rules.operator_case_equality = true
```

This ruleset has further rules which don't depend on each other or combine
to provide additional properties.
Please see their individual explanations for details.
Note, in the related **ruleset-verifintent**, the rule
**keyword_forbidden_always** is not enabled because it is perfectly reasonable
for a simulation testbench to schedule assignments, tasks, and functions in
ways that wouldn't make sense for synthesizable hardware.
```toml
rules.action_block_with_side_effect = true
rules.default_nettype_none = true
rules.function_same_as_system_function = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_always = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_wire_reg = true
rules.non_ansi_module = true
```

When synthesised into a netlist, generate blocks should have labels so that
their inferred logic can be detected in hierarchical paths.
Although the LRM is clear about the implict naming of unlabelled generate
blocks, see IEEE1800-2017 clause 27.6, using a well-named label provides some
clarification about the author's intention for that logic.
In the similar **ruleset-verifintent**, these rules are not enabled because
they (mostly) relate to synthesizable hardware.
```toml
rules.generate_case_with_label = true
rules.generate_for_with_label = true
rules.generate_if_with_label = true
```

Generally, elaboration-time constant (`parameter`, `localparam`) should be
2-state types and always supplied with some default value.
Additionally, where the context defines that `parameter` is an alias for
`localparam`, author's should demonstate that they understand the constant
cannot be overriden by using the `localparam` keyword.
```toml
rules.localparam_type_twostate = true
rules.parameter_type_twostate = true
rules.localparam_explicit_type = true
rules.parameter_explicit_type = true
rules.parameter_default_value = true
rules.parameter_in_generate = true
rules.parameter_in_package = true
```

Genvars, which are also elaboration-time constants, should be declared within
generate `for` loops to reduce their scope.
This allows readers to be confident that they can see all of the relevant
information about a genvar in one place, i.e. declaration and usage.
A notable advantage of declaring genvars in each generate loop is that authors
are encouraged to give their genvars suitably descriptive names.
Rules on the use of the `generate` and `endgenerate` keywords is similarly
subjective, but this ruleset forbids their use because readers should be aware
that all `case`, `for`, and `if` blocks outside of assignment processes are
generate blocks.
Further, the use of `generate` and `endgenerate` is entirely optional with no
semantic difference to not using them.
```toml
rules.genvar_declaration_in_loop = true
rules.genvar_declaration_out_loop = false
rules.keyword_forbidden_generate = true
rules.keyword_required_generate = false
```

Rules in the below subset combine to provide an important property for the
robust design of synthesizable hardware - that you can easily draw a schematic
of what the synthesis result should look like.
The two rules of thumb are to always fully specify decision logic, and never
use procedural models for (what will be synthesized to) parallel logic.
```toml
rules.explicit_case_default = true
rules.explicit_if_else = true
rules.loop_statement_in_always_comb = true
rules.loop_statement_in_always_ff = true
rules.loop_statement_in_always_latch = true
rules.sequential_block_in_always_comb = true
rules.sequential_block_in_always_ff = true
rules.sequential_block_in_always_latch = true
```

Where sequential modelling of parallel logic is an unavoidable pragmatic
approach, using the `begin` and `end` keywords should be done carefully with
proper indentation.
Note, this ruleset does *not* check the amount of indentation like
**style_indent**.
```toml
rules.multiline_for_begin = true
rules.multiline_if_begin = true
```

The semantics around port declarations are, perhaps, unintuitive but were
designed for backward compliance with Verilog (IEEE1364-1995).
The below subset ensures that port declarations clearly convey important
information about the direction and update mechanism of each signal port.
```toml
rules.inout_with_tri = true
rules.input_with_var = true
rules.output_with_var = true
rules.interface_port_with_modport = true
```



* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Ruleset: *parseonly*

If a file passes this ruleset you have these pieces of information:

- The file is valid UTF-8.
- svlint's preprocessor can successfully parse and emit text.
- The emitted text is valid SystemVerilog adhering to Annex A of IEEE1800-2017,
  i.e. there are no syntax errors.


### Disable All Rules

All rules are implicitly disabled, and all options are implicitly set to their
default values.
Despite non of svlint's rules being enabled, this instructs the files to be
preprocessed and parsed, i.e. internally processed from text to a syntax tree.

```toml
[option]
[rules]
```


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Ruleset: *simsynth*

The set of checks which detect potential mismatches between simulation and
synthesis.

Unlike the rules in, for example, **ruleset-style**, the rules in this ruleset
do not depend on each other or combine to check additional properties.
See the explanations of individual rules for their details.

```toml
rules.blocking_assignment_in_always_ff = true
rules.blocking_assignment_in_always_latch = true
rules.non_blocking_assignment_in_always_comb = true
rules.case_default = true
rules.enum_with_type = true
rules.function_with_automatic = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_priority = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_unique = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_unique0 = true
rules.level_sensitive_always = true
rules.operator_case_equality = true
```



* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Ruleset: *style*

The set of whitespace-only checks which are "suggested" in the explanations
of the **style_** rules.


### Motivation

Style conventions also help a human reader to quickly and efficiently
comprehend large bodies of code.
Indeed, that is exactly what a reader wants to do when they're working with
code written by other people, often complete strangers.
The reader simply wishes to open the file, extract the necessary information,
close the file, and get on with their life.
Unlike mechanical tools, people process code visually (by translating their
view of the screen into a mental model) and any noise which obscures the useful
information will require extra mental effort to process.
When code is written with consistent and regular whitespace, the important
details like operators and identifiers are easily extracted.
In contrast, when little attention is paid to indentation or spaces around
keywords, operators, or identifers, the readers must waste their energy
performing a mental noise reduction.
Therefore, the main motivation behind this ruleset is to avoid visual noise.

Two notable style conventions help with a change-review process, i.e. comparing
multiple versions of a file, rather than reading one version:

- Line length limited to a fixed number of characters, usually 80.
  - Excessively long lines may indicate problems with a program's logic.
  - Excessively long lines prevent viewing differences side-by-side.
  - Side-by-side reading is awkward when sideways scrolling is involved.
  - Code which is printed on paper cannot be scrolled sideways, and soft-wrap
    alternatives interrupt indentation.
- Trailing whitespace is forbidden.
  - Changes to trailing whitespace are not usually visible to human readers,
    but are found by version control tools.
  - Editors are often configured to remove trailing whitespace, resulting in
    unnecessary differences.
  - Git, a popular version control tool will (by default) warn against trailing
    whitespace with prominent markers specifically because of the unnecessary
    noise introduced to a repository's history.

These conventions help give a consistent view over different ways of viewing
files which include the writer's text editor (Vim, VSCode, Emacs, etc.),
consumer's text editor, reviewer's web-based tools (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab,
etc.), printed material (e.g. via PDF), and logfiles from CI/CD tools (GitHub
Actions, Bamboo, Jenkins, etc).


### Test Each File for Excessively Long Lines

To get a list of all the files examined by a particular invocation of svlint,
use the variable `${SVFILES}`, which is provided in all POSIX wrapper scripts.

The `grep` utility can be used to detect, and report, lines longer than a given
number of characters.
```sh
TEXTWIDTH='80'
LINELEN="grep -EvIxHn --color '.{0,${TEXTWIDTH}}' {};"
LINELEN="${LINELEN} if [ \"\$?\" -eq \"0\" ]; then"
LINELEN="${LINELEN}   echo '!!! Lines longer than ${TEXTWIDTH} characters !!!';"
LINELEN="${LINELEN}   exit 1;"
LINELEN="${LINELEN} else"
LINELEN="${LINELEN}   exit 0;"
LINELEN="${LINELEN} fi"
eval "${SVFILES}" | xargs -I {} sh -c "${LINELEN}"
```

Another use of `grep` is to report obfuscated statements where semicolons are
pushed off the RHS of the screen.
```sh
OBFUSTMT="grep -EIHn --color '[ ]+;' {};"
OBFUSTMT="${OBFUSTMT} if [ \"\$?\" -eq \"0\" ]; then"
OBFUSTMT="${OBFUSTMT}   echo '!!! Potentially obfuscated statements !!!';"
OBFUSTMT="${OBFUSTMT}   exit 1;"
OBFUSTMT="${OBFUSTMT} else"
OBFUSTMT="${OBFUSTMT}   exit 0;"
OBFUSTMT="${OBFUSTMT} fi"
eval "${SVFILES}" | xargs -I {} sh -c "${OBFUSTMT}"
```

On Windows, the default environment does not contain utilities such as `grep`,
so some system-specific scripting may be more appropriate.


### Indentation

An indent of 2 spaces, not tabs, is chosen.
For better or worse, contemporary computer language styles have moved
decisively away from using tabs for indentation.
The most likely reason behind this is that tab display width is configurable
so tab indentations are shown differently, depending on the reader's personal
configuration.
```toml
option.indent = 2
rules.tab_character = true
rules.style_indent = true
```
Note that the **style_indent** rule does not check that indentations are the
correct level - only that the indentation is an integer multiple of 2 spaces.

In SystemVerilog, most of the language is independent of whitespace characters,
so readers are (hopefully) aware that they should be careful not to interpret
indentation with semantic meaning, but its human nature to do so.
Therefore, author care is still required to use the correct indent, i.e.
**style_indent** only points out indentations which are obviously wrong, but
does not understand the logical semantics of any SystemVerilog constructs.

```systemverilog
always_comb begin
  x = 0;
  y = 123;

  if (a)
    x = 1;
  else
    x = 2;
    y = 666;

  z = y + x;
end
```
Above is a simple demonstration of how the human eye can be misled in ways
that mechanical tools like compilers are immune to.
Depending on the value of expression `a`, the variable `z` takes the value
either `667` or `668`, but never `124`.
To mitigate the risk of confusion around multi-line conditional statements and
loops, two further rules are enabled to check that either `begin`/`end`
keyword delimiters are used, or the statement is moved to the same line as the
condition.
```toml
rules.multiline_if_begin = true
rules.multiline_for_begin = true
```


### Indentation Preprocessor Considerations

A potential source of confusion is in the use of the preprocessor to
accidentally introduce whitespace.
In these examples, a dot character (`.`) is used to visually present a space
character where it's important.
```systemverilog
`ifdef A
..foo();
`endif.// A space between the "endif" directive and the line comment
```
If `A` is defined, the above example will be emitted from the preprocessor as
this text:
```systemverilog
foo();
.// A space between the "endif" directive and the line comment
```
The line after `foo()` begins with a 1 space, which violates the
**style_indent** check.
Note that the violation occurs even if `A` is not defined.

To further confuse things, the following example will *not* cause a violation
when `A` is undefined!
```systemverilog
.`ifdef A
..foo();
.`endif.// A space between the "endif" directive and the line comment
```
The 1 space on the `ifdef` line is joined to the 1 space after `endif` to make
a line with a 2 space indent like this:
```systemverilog
..// A space between the "endif" directive and the line comment
```

Confusing situations like these arise from the fact that SystemVerilog is a
combination of two languages;

1. A text processing language (defining the preprocessor) in specified
  informally in IEEE1800-2017 Clause 22 among other compiler directives.
2. The rest of SystemVerilog syntax is formally called `source_text`, is
  specified formally in IEEE1800-2017 Annex A.

Svlint rules operate on the `source_text` part of SystemVerilog, i.e. after the
preprocessor has been applied.
As with other languages with similar text-based templating features, most
notably C, use of the preprocessor is discouraged except where absolutely
necessary.
To avoid confusion with preprocessor, here are two recommendations:

1. Don't indent compiler directives, especially preprocessor statements
  containing any `source_text`.
2. Don't put any spaces between compiler directives and comments on the same
   line.

These are some examples of confusion-ridden style, not recommended.
```systemverilog
`define Z // Space then comment
`ifdef A // Space then comment
..`ifdef B// Indented ifdef
....foo(); // Indent of source_text mixed with preprocessor
..`endif// Indented endif
`endif // Space then comment
```
The above examples can be reformed like this:
```systemverilog
`define Z// No space then comment
`ifdef A// No space then comment
`ifdef B
..foo();
`endif// B
`endif// A
```

Where no `source_text` is contained in the ifdef block, i.e. only preprocessor
definitions, these may be indented without causing confusion:
```systemverilog
`ifdef A
..`ifdef B
....`define Z
..`endif// B
`endif// A
```
For clarification, when both `A` and `B` are defined, the above block will be
emitted from the svlint preprocessor as shown below.
```systemverilog
`define Z
..// B
// A
```

One method which can help catch unintended whitespace, both from the
preprocessor and written by hand, is to forbid trailing spaces, i.e. space
characters followed immediately by a newline.
```toml
rules.style_trailingwhitespace = true
```

Problems around indented preprocessor directives must be caught before svlint's
preprocessor stage, so searching with `grep` beforehand is appropriate.
```sh
PPDIRECTIVES="define|undef|undefineall|resetall"
PPDIRECTIVES="${PPDIRECTIVES}|ifdef|ifndef|elsif|else|endif"
PPDIRECTIVES="${PPDIRECTIVES}|include"

PPINDENT="grep -EIHn --color '[ ]+\`(${PPDIRECTIVES})' {};"
PPINDENT="${PPINDENT} if [ \"\$?\" -eq \"0\" ]; then"
PPINDENT="${PPINDENT}   echo '!!! Indented preprocessor directives !!!';"
PPINDENT="${PPINDENT}   exit 1;"
PPINDENT="${PPINDENT} else"
PPINDENT="${PPINDENT}   exit 0;"
PPINDENT="${PPINDENT} fi"
eval "${SVFILES}" | xargs -I {} sh -c "${PPINDENT}"
```


### Operators and Keywords

Consistent use of whitespace around operators and keywords makes it easier to
read expressions quickly and accurately.
```toml
rules.style_operator_arithmetic = true
rules.style_operator_boolean = true
rules.style_operator_integer = true
rules.style_operator_unary = true

rules.style_keyword_0or1space = true
rules.style_keyword_0space = true
rules.style_keyword_1or2space = true
rules.style_keyword_1space = true
rules.style_keyword_construct = true
rules.style_keyword_datatype = false # Overly restrictive.
rules.style_keyword_end = true
rules.style_keyword_maybelabel = true
rules.style_keyword_new = true
rules.style_keyword_newline = true
```


### Comma-Separated Lists

SystemVerilog code has many uses for comma-separated lists of items specified
in IEEE1800-2017 Annex A.
Most of these uses can be found by searching for BNF symbols containing the
string `list_of_`, but uses are specified in BNF expressions for other symbols,
e.g. `modport_declaration` and `data_type`.

Without careful review processes in place, the large variety semantics and
syntax surrounding comma-separated lists can easily lead authors writing in a
large variety of styles.
To make matters worse, the use of comma-separated lists varies is common in
other languages - but with significant subtle differences.
For example, while Python and Rust allow an extra comma after the last argument
in a function call, C and SystemVerilog do not allow this.

The desire for consistent formatting and readability provides motivation for a
simple rule which can be easily remembered by authors.
The most common style in functional programming language Haskell provides
inspiration for such a rule:
"Every comma must be followed by exactly one space".
```toml
rules.style_commaleading = true
```

This rule leads to the comma-leading style which, although perhaps unfamiliar
to authors with a background in C or Python, has a number of advantages.
- The rule is extremely simple, especially in comparison to the multitude of
  rules requried to format comma-trailing lists consistently.
- A comma character is visually similar to bullet-point.
- When changing code over time, it's more common to add items to the end of a
  list than the beginning.
  This means that comma-leading style often leads to diffs which are easier to
  review.
  Closely related to this is that comma-leading style makes it less likely to
  introduce an extra comma at the end of a list (which would be a syntax
  error).
- Multi-dimensional arrays are easier to read, because it's natural to put a
  line without elements (only the closing `}`) between elements of the
  more-significant axis.
- Comma is visually similar to bulletpoint (a common symbol for introducing an
  item of a list in prose).
- Comma-leading style can be said to be more closely aligned with BNF
  specification, e.g.
  `list_of_genvar_identifiers ::= genvar_identifier { , genvar_identifier }`.
  This is reflected by how sv-parser attaches `Comment` nodes (which contain
  whitespace) to the RHS of comma symbols.

For some examples, please see the explanation of the **style_commaleading**
rule.

Additionally, `eventlist_or` mandates the use of `,` (comma) as the separator
in `always_ff` sensitivity lists only for consistency and readabilty.
```toml
rules.eventlist_or = true
```



* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Ruleset: *verifintent*

Rules that forbid suspicious constructions, i.e. those which are legal
according to the LRM, but may express their intention unclearly.
This ruleset is similar to **ruleset-designintent**, but with some rules
enabled or disabled where they are applicable to testbench code (instead of
synthesizable digital logic).

While this ruleset is *not* a superset of **ruleset-simsynth**, some of those
rules are also useful for testbench/verification code.
A clean separation of (non-)blocking assignments and `always_(comb|ff)`
processes is useful to prevent the specification of processes with scheduling
semantics which are difficult to reason about.

```toml
rules.blocking_assignment_in_always_ff = true
rules.non_blocking_assignment_in_always_comb = true
rules.enum_with_type = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_priority = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_unique = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_unique0 = true
```

This ruleset has further rules which don't depend on each other or combine
to provide additional properties.
Please see their individual explanations for details.
Note, in the related **ruleset-designintent**, an additional rule
**keyword_forbidden_always** is enabled.
```toml
rules.action_block_with_side_effect = true
rules.default_nettype_none = true
rules.function_same_as_system_function = true
rules.keyword_forbidden_wire_reg = true
rules.non_ansi_module = true
```

Generally, elaboration-time constant (`parameter`, `localparam`) should be
2-state types and always supplied with some default value.
Additionally, where the context defines that `parameter` is an alias for
`localparam`, author's should demonstate that they understand the constant
cannot be overriden by using the `localparam` keyword.
```toml
rules.localparam_type_twostate = true
rules.parameter_type_twostate = true
rules.localparam_explicit_type = true
rules.parameter_explicit_type = true
rules.parameter_default_value = true
rules.parameter_in_generate = true
rules.parameter_in_package = true
```

Genvars, which are also elaboration-time constants, should be declared within
generate `for` loops to reduce their scope.
This allows readers to be confident that they can see all of the relevant
information about a genvar in one place, i.e. declaration and usage.
A notable advantage of declaring genvars in each generate loop is that authors
are encouraged to give their genvars suitably descriptive names.
Rules on the use of the `generate` and `endgenerate` keywords is similarly
subjective, but this ruleset forbids their use because readers should be aware
that all `case`, `for`, and `if` blocks outside of assignment processes are
generate blocks.
Further, the use of `generate` and `endgenerate` is entirely optional with no
semantic difference to not using them.
```toml
rules.genvar_declaration_in_loop = true
rules.genvar_declaration_out_loop = false
rules.keyword_forbidden_generate = true
rules.keyword_required_generate = false
```

To prevent difficult-to-read procedural code, using the `begin` and `end`
keywords should be done carefully with proper indentation.
Note, this ruleset does *not* check the amount of indentation like
**style_indent**.
```toml
rules.multiline_for_begin = true
rules.multiline_if_begin = true
```

The semantics around port declarations are, perhaps, unintuitive but were
designed for backward compliance with Verilog (IEEE1364-1995).
The below subset ensures that port declarations clearly convey important
information about the direction and update mechanism of each signal port.
```toml
rules.inout_with_tri = true
rules.input_with_var = true
rules.output_with_var = true
rules.interface_port_with_modport = true
```
