There are 3 usual types of SystemVerilog file for synthesizable design code
(module, interface, package) and having a simple naming convention helps
distinguish them from a filesystem viewpoint.
In Haskell, types/typeclasses must start with an uppercase letter, and
functions/variables must start with a lowercase letter.
This rule checks part of a related naming scheme where modules and interfaces
should start with a lowercase letter, and packages should start with an
uppercase letter.
