The reasoning behind this rule are different between combinatial constructs
(`always_comb`, `always @*`) vs sequential constructs (`always_ff`,
`always_latch`).
The reasoning behind this rule is equivalent to that of **explicit_case_default**.

For combinational constructs, the reasoning behind this rule is equivalent to
that of the rule **case_default**.
To summarize, an incompletely-specified case statement may infer sequential
behavior (i.e. memory), thus causing a mismatch between simulation and synthesis
tools.

For sequential constructs, the reasoning behind this rule is equivalent to
those of the rules **sequential_block_in_always_ff** and
**sequential_block_in_always_latch**.
To summarize, fully-specified case statements make the design intent explicit
and clear through some useful redundancy.

NOTE: The legacy keyword `always` can infer both combinational and sequential
constructs in the same block, which can be confusing and should be avoided.
Use of the legacy keyword can be detected with the rule **legacy_always**.
