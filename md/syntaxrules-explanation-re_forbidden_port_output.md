Output ports must not have identifiers matching the regex configured via the
`re_forbidden_port_output` option.

NOTE: For performance reasons, particularly within text-editor integrations
(i.e. svls), the `re_(required|forbidden)_` should only be used where the
simpler naming rules are not sufficient.

- **re_required_port_output**
- **prefix_output**
